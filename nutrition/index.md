# Base Program

A daily nutrition framework for someone lifting 4 days per week with 2 conditioning days (as prescribed in the [lifting program](../lift/index.md)). Do exactly this. Every macro target, meal, and supplement is specified -- don't improvise until you've run this for at least 8 weeks. Nutrition matters more than exercise selection for body composition, but not as much as consistency. The single most important number is protein intake.

**Bodyweight assumption:** Targets below are given per pound of bodyweight. A 180 lb person is used in the [sample day](#sample-day). Adjust proportionally.

## Daily Targets

| Nutrient | Target | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Calories | 16 x bodyweight (lb) | Maintenance for moderate activity. Adjust per [body composition goals](#body-composition-goals). |
| Protein | 1 g per lb bodyweight | Non-negotiable floor. More is fine, less costs muscle. |
| Carbohydrates | 1.5-2 g per lb bodyweight | Primary fuel for lifting. Higher end on training days. |
| Fat | 0.3-0.4 g per lb bodyweight | Hormonal floor. Don't go below 0.3 g/lb. |
| Fiber | 30-40 g | From whole food sources. |

Protein is set first -- it is the only macronutrient with a hard minimum for muscle retention and growth. Fat is set second at its hormonal floor. Remaining calories fill in as carbohydrates. If calories need to drop for fat loss, reduce carbs and fats proportionally -- never reduce protein below 1 g/lb.

## Meal Structure

Four meals per day, roughly evenly spaced. Each meal contains a [protein source](#protein-sources), a [carbohydrate source](#carbohydrate-sources), and vegetables. This is simpler than it sounds.

| Meal | Timing | Protein | Carbs | Fat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 (Breakfast) | Within 1 hour of waking | 40 g | 50-60 g | 15 g |
| 2 (Lunch) | 4-5 hours after Meal 1 | 40 g | 50-60 g | 15 g |
| 3 (Pre/Post-Training) | Around training | 40 g | 60-80 g | 10 g |
| 4 (Dinner) | 2-3 hours before bed | 40 g | 40-50 g | 15-20 g |

On rest days, drop Meal 3 carbs to match Meal 1 levels and distribute the remainder across meals. Total protein stays the same every day.

**Pre-workout:** Eat Meal 3 sixty to ninety minutes before training, or split it -- half before, half after. A full stomach during squats is miserable; an empty stomach kills performance. Find the timing that lets you train hard without nausea.

**Post-workout:** If you split Meal 3, eat the second half within 60 minutes of finishing. The "anabolic window" is overhyped, but training fasted with no post-workout meal for hours is suboptimal. Just eat.

## Sample Day

A 180 lb person on a training day. Targets: ~2,880 cal, ~180 g protein, ~320 g carbs, ~65 g fat.

| Meal | Food | Protein | Carbs | Fat | Cal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | 4 whole eggs, scrambled | 24 g | 2 g | 20 g | 280 |
| | 1 cup oatmeal (dry) with 1 scoop whey | 35 g | 57 g | 7 g | 430 |
| | 1 banana | 1 g | 27 g | 0 g | 105 |
| **2** | 8 oz chicken breast | 50 g | 0 g | 4 g | 240 |
| | 2 cups white rice (cooked) | 8 g | 90 g | 0 g | 400 |
| | 1 cup broccoli + 1 tsp olive oil | 3 g | 6 g | 5 g | 75 |
| **3** | 1 scoop whey protein + 1 banana | 26 g | 30 g | 2 g | 235 |
| | 2 rice cakes + 1 tbsp peanut butter | 5 g | 22 g | 8 g | 180 |
| **4** | 6 oz salmon fillet | 34 g | 0 g | 14 g | 260 |
| | 1 large sweet potato | 5 g | 50 g | 0 g | 220 |
| | Mixed salad + 1 tbsp olive oil | 3 g | 8 g | 14 g | 170 |
| | 1 cup white rice (cooked) | 4 g | 45 g | 0 g | 200 |
| **Totals** | | **198 g** | **337 g** | **74 g** | **2,795** |

Close to targets. Exact totals vary by brand and portion size -- the pattern matters more than decimal precision. Use a food scale for the first 2 weeks until you can eyeball portions reliably. To cut calories, reduce rice portions first. To add calories, add more rice or another piece of fruit.

## Base Supplements

Take these daily. Everything else is optional or unsupported.

| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Creatine monohydrate | 5 g | Any time, daily | Most studied ergogenic aid in existence. Increases strength, power, and lean mass. |
| Vitamin D3 | 2,000-5,000 IU | With a fat-containing meal | Most people are deficient. Supports bone density, immune function, and hormonal health. |
| Omega-3 (EPA/DHA) | 1-2 g combined EPA+DHA | With a meal | Anti-inflammatory. Supports cardiovascular and joint health. Skip if eating fatty fish 3+ times per week. |
| Magnesium glycinate | 200-400 mg | Before bed | Most people are deficient. Supports sleep quality, muscle relaxation, and recovery. |

Creatine does not need a loading phase. 5 g daily reaches saturation in 3-4 weeks. Take it every day, including rest days.

## Base Hydration

- Minimum: 0.5 oz per pound of bodyweight daily (90 oz for a 180 lb person).
- Add 16-24 oz per hour of training.
- First thing in the morning: 16 oz water before anything else.
- Drink water with every meal.

If your urine is dark yellow, you are dehydrated. Pale yellow to clear is the target. Coffee and tea count toward fluid intake. Alcohol does not -- it is a net dehydrator.

When you've run this for 8+ weeks and want to understand the reasoning, adjust for specific goals, or optimize further, read the [Comprehensive Nutrition Guide](#comprehensive-nutrition-guide) below.

# Comprehensive Nutrition Guide

Nutrition recommendations organized by category. Each section explains what to do, why, and what was considered and rejected. Cross-references link to the [Food Reference](#food-reference) for specific food choices and to [Factors](#factors-for-nutrition-decisions) for individual adjustments.

## Macronutrients

### Protein

**Target: 1 g per pound of bodyweight daily.** This is the single most important dietary variable for anyone lifting weights. Protein provides the amino acids that repair and build muscle tissue. Below 0.7 g/lb, you measurably sacrifice muscle protein synthesis. Above 1 g/lb, returns diminish but there is no downside (within reason) -- excess protein is either oxidized for energy or excreted, not stored as fat in meaningful amounts at normal intakes.

**Distribution matters.** Spread protein across 3-5 meals with at least 25-40 g per meal. Muscle protein synthesis is maximally stimulated per meal at roughly 0.4 g/kg bodyweight (about 30-40 g for most people). Eating 150 g in one meal and nothing the rest of the day is less effective than 4 meals of 40 g.

**Leucine is the trigger.** The amino acid leucine is the primary signal for muscle protein synthesis. Animal proteins are leucine-dense; plant proteins require larger servings to hit the ~2.5 g leucine threshold per meal. This is not an argument against plant protein -- it is an argument for eating more of it per sitting or combining sources.

**Best sources:** [Chicken breast](#chicken-breast), [eggs](#eggs), [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt), [whey protein](#whey-protein), [salmon](#salmon), [lean beef](#lean-beef). See [Protein Sources](#protein-sources) for the full list.

1.5 g/lb removed: no additional benefit over 1 g/lb in controlled studies, and it crowds out carbohydrates that fuel training. 0.8 g/lb removed: sufficient for sedentary individuals, insufficient for those training hard.

### Carbohydrates

**Target: 1.5-2 g per pound of bodyweight on training days.** Carbohydrates are stored as muscle glycogen, which is the primary fuel for resistance training. Glycogen-depleted muscles produce less force and recover more slowly. Low-carb diets are not optimal for lifting performance.

**Quality hierarchy:** Prioritize complex carbohydrates ([rice](#white-rice), [oats](#oats), [potatoes](#potatoes), [sweet potatoes](#sweet-potatoes)) for sustained energy. Use simple carbohydrates ([fruit](#fruit), [rice cakes](#rice-cakes)) around training when rapid digestion is beneficial. Avoid added sugars as a primary carb source -- they lack fiber, micronutrients, and satiety.

**Training day vs. rest day:** Training days get the full 1.5-2 g/lb. Rest days can drop to 1-1.5 g/lb since glycogen demand is lower. The difference goes toward fat or is simply removed if cutting.

**Fiber:** 30-40 g daily from whole food sources. Fiber supports gut health, satiety, and blood sugar regulation. Don't supplement fiber -- eat vegetables, oats, and legumes instead.

Ketogenic diets removed: they impair high-intensity exercise performance and provide no fat loss advantage at equal calories. The metabolic "advantage" of ketosis does not survive controlled isocaloric studies. Carb cycling removed: unnecessarily complex for the marginal benefit. Eat more carbs on training days, fewer on rest days -- that is sufficient periodization.

### Fats

**Target: 0.3-0.4 g per pound of bodyweight daily.** Fat is essential for hormone production (including testosterone), cell membrane integrity, and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Below 0.3 g/lb, hormonal disruption becomes a real risk -- particularly testosterone suppression in men.

**Source quality matters more than quantity.** Prioritize monounsaturated fats ([olive oil](#olive-oil), [avocado](#avocado)) and omega-3 polyunsaturated fats ([fatty fish](#salmon), [walnuts](#walnuts)). Limit saturated fat to <10% of total calories -- enough comes naturally from [eggs](#eggs), [lean beef](#lean-beef), and dairy without seeking it out. Eliminate trans fats entirely.

**Omega-6 to omega-3 ratio:** The modern diet is heavily skewed toward omega-6 (from seed oils and processed foods). Aim for a ratio below 4:1 by increasing omega-3 intake ([fatty fish](#salmon), [fish oil supplements](#base-supplements)) and reducing fried and processed food consumption.

Extremely low fat diets (<15% of calories) removed: they suppress testosterone, impair fat-soluble vitamin absorption, and make food unpalatable. High-fat diets (>40% of calories) removed: they crowd out carbohydrates needed for training performance.

## Micronutrients

Most micronutrient needs are met by eating a varied diet with adequate vegetables, fruits, and quality protein sources. The following are the most common deficiencies among active individuals and deserve specific attention.

### Key Deficiencies to Address

| Micronutrient | Why It Matters | Best Food Sources | Supplement If Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Vitamin D | Bone density, immune function, testosterone | Sunlight, [salmon](#salmon), fortified dairy | 2,000-5,000 IU D3 daily |
| Magnesium | Sleep, muscle function, 300+ enzymatic processes | Spinach, pumpkin seeds, dark chocolate | 200-400 mg glycinate before bed |
| Iron | Oxygen transport, energy production | [Lean beef](#lean-beef), spinach, lentils | Only supplement if blood work confirms deficiency |
| Zinc | Testosterone production, immune function | [Lean beef](#lean-beef), oysters, pumpkin seeds | 15-30 mg if dietary intake is low |
| Potassium | Muscle contractions, blood pressure | [Potatoes](#potatoes), bananas, [avocado](#avocado) | Rarely needed with adequate vegetable intake |
| Calcium | Bone density, muscle contractions | Dairy, [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt), sardines | 500-1,000 mg if dairy-free |

Eat at least 2-3 servings of vegetables daily and 1-2 servings of fruit across different colors. This covers most micronutrient gaps without a multivitamin.

Multivitamins removed: they provide sub-therapeutic doses of everything and therapeutic doses of nothing. Most water-soluble vitamins are excreted in excess. Target your actual deficiencies instead of spraying and praying.

### Sodium

Sodium is not a villain for active individuals. Lifting and conditioning cause significant sodium loss through sweat. Unless you have diagnosed hypertension, do not restrict sodium. Salt your food to taste. If you cramp during training or feel lightheaded, you likely need more sodium, not less. Target 3,000-5,000 mg daily.

## Hydration

### Water

**Target: 0.5 oz per pound of bodyweight daily, plus 16-24 oz per hour of training.** Water is the medium for every metabolic process. Even 2% dehydration measurably reduces strength and endurance performance.

**Practical protocol:**
- 16 oz immediately upon waking.
- 16 oz with each meal (4 meals = 64 oz).
- 16-24 oz per hour of training.
- Sip throughout the day -- don't try to catch up with large volumes at once.

### Electrolytes

Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) regulate fluid balance and muscle contractions. If you are eating adequate food, salting your meals, and taking [magnesium](#base-supplements), you are likely covered. Add an electrolyte supplement during extended training sessions (>90 minutes) or in hot conditions.

Coconut water removed: overpriced for the electrolyte content. Sports drinks (Gatorade, etc.) removed: sugar delivery vehicles with minimal electrolytes. Plain water plus salted meals is more effective and cheaper.

### What to Minimize

- **Alcohol:** Directly impairs muscle protein synthesis, disrupts sleep architecture, and dehydrates. A couple of drinks on the weekend will not ruin your progress, but daily drinking will. One to two drinks max, no more than twice per week.
- **Sugary beverages:** Empty calories with no satiety. Soda, juice, sweetened coffee drinks -- cut them. Diet versions are fine.

## Meal Timing and Frequency

### How Many Meals

**Four meals per day.** This is not magical -- it is practical. Four meals makes it easy to distribute protein evenly (4 x 40 g = 160 g) and keeps you fueled without constant eating. Three meals works if each one is larger. Five or six meals works if you prefer smaller portions. The non-negotiable is protein distribution: at least 25-40 g per meal, separated by 3-5 hours.

Intermittent fasting removed: it compresses the eating window, making it harder to consume adequate protein and calories for someone training hard. The autophagy and insulin sensitivity benefits are real but modest and do not outweigh the practical difficulty of fitting 160+ g of protein into 8 hours while training. If you strongly prefer it, it can work -- but it is not the default recommendation.

Six meals per day removed: unnecessarily disruptive to daily life. The "stoke the metabolic fire" rationale is a myth -- meal frequency does not affect metabolic rate at equal total intake.

### Pre-Workout

Eat a meal containing protein and carbohydrates 60-90 minutes before training. Fats slow digestion, so keep this meal lower in fat. The goal is to have available amino acids and glycogen without a full stomach.

**Good options:** [Rice](#white-rice) + [chicken](#chicken-breast), [oats](#oats) + [whey protein](#whey-protein), [rice cakes](#rice-cakes) + [peanut butter](#natural-peanut-butter) + protein shake.

Training fully fasted removed: performance suffers measurably. The "fasted cardio burns more fat" claim does not hold over 24-hour energy balance.

### Post-Workout

Eat a meal containing protein and carbohydrates within 60 minutes of finishing training. The post-workout meal starts the recovery process, replenishes glycogen, and provides amino acids when muscle protein synthesis is elevated.

**Good options:** [Whey protein](#whey-protein) shake + banana (immediate), followed by a full meal within 1-2 hours. Or just eat a full meal.

The "anabolic window" is not a 30-minute cliff. But training hard and then not eating for 4+ hours is a missed opportunity. Just eat a meal after you train.

### Around Sleep

**Last meal 2-3 hours before bed.** Too full disrupts sleep; too hungry impairs overnight recovery. A moderate meal with protein and moderate carbs is ideal. 30-40 g of [casein protein](#casein-protein) or [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt) before bed is supported by evidence -- slow digestion maintains amino acid availability through the overnight fast.

Carbs before bed do not make you fat. Total daily calories determine body composition, not the clock. Carbs may improve sleep onset through serotonin pathways.

## Supplements

Supplements fill gaps in an otherwise solid diet. They do not replace food. The list below is organized by evidence quality.

### Tier 1: Strong Evidence (Use These)

| Supplement | Dose | Mechanism | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Creatine monohydrate | 5 g daily | Increases phosphocreatine stores, improving power output and recovery between sets | The most studied supplement in history. Monohydrate is the form used in research. |
| Whey protein | As needed to hit protein target | Fast-digesting, leucine-rich complete protein | A convenience, not a necessity. Real food is equivalent. |
| Vitamin D3 | 2,000-5,000 IU daily | Corrects a near-universal deficiency | Get blood work; adjust dose to maintain 40-60 ng/mL. |
| Omega-3 (fish oil) | 1-2 g EPA+DHA daily | Anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular protection | Skip if eating fatty fish 3+ times weekly. |
| Magnesium glycinate | 200-400 mg before bed | Sleep quality, muscle relaxation | Glycinate or threonate forms are best absorbed. Oxide is poorly absorbed. |

### Tier 2: Moderate Evidence (Situational Use)

| Supplement | Dose | Mechanism | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Caffeine | 3-6 mg/kg bodyweight | Increases alertness, reduces perceived exertion, improves power output | Take 30-60 min before training. Cycle off periodically to maintain sensitivity. |
| Casein protein | 30-40 g before bed | Slow-digesting protein provides overnight amino acid supply | [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt) is a whole-food alternative with the same benefit. |
| Zinc | 15-30 mg daily | Supports testosterone and immune function | Only if dietary intake is low (little red meat or shellfish). |
| Ashwagandha | 300-600 mg daily | Cortisol reduction, modest testosterone support, improved recovery | KSM-66 or Sensoril extracts specifically. Effects are modest. |

### Removed Supplements

**BCAAs** removed: redundant if you eat adequate protein. Whey already contains all three BCAAs in higher amounts. Paying for BCAAs on top of whey is paying for a subset of what you already have.

**Pre-workout blends** removed: proprietary blends underdose most ingredients. Just take caffeine (pill or coffee) and creatine separately. You know exactly what you are getting and it costs a fraction.

**Testosterone boosters** (tribulus, D-aspartic acid, fenugreek) removed: none produce meaningful testosterone increases in humans with normal levels. Save your money.

**Fat burners** removed: stimulant-based with marginal thermogenic effects. Caffeine is the only effective thermogenic ingredient, and you can get it from coffee.

**Glutamine** removed: the body produces sufficient glutamine endogenously. Supplementation does not enhance recovery or immune function in well-fed individuals.

**Collagen peptides** removed: marketed for joint health, but evidence for athletic populations is weak. The amino acid profile is poor for muscle building (low leucine). If joints hurt, address training load and technique first.

# Food Reference

Recommended foods organized by macronutrient category. Each entry describes the food, why it is recommended over alternatives, and when to choose it. Nutrition values are approximate per standard serving.

## Protein Sources

### Chicken Breast

Boneless, skinless chicken breast. The leanest widely available protein source at 31 g protein and 3.6 g fat per 100 g (cooked). Mild flavor absorbs marinades and seasonings well. The default protein source for a reason -- high protein density, low cost, and easy to [batch cook](#batch-cooking). Choose this over fattier cuts when you need protein without extra calories. Choose [salmon](#salmon) when you need omega-3s, or [lean beef](#lean-beef) when you need iron and zinc.

### Eggs

Whole eggs. 6 g protein and 5 g fat per large egg, with a complete amino acid profile and high bioavailability. The yolk contains most of the micronutrients (choline, vitamin D, B12, selenium) and should not be discarded. Egg whites alone removed: discarding the yolk throws away half the protein and nearly all the micronutrients for a trivial calorie savings. Eat the whole egg. Choose eggs for breakfast convenience and micronutrient density. Choose [chicken breast](#chicken-breast) when you need higher protein with less fat.

### Greek Yogurt

Plain, nonfat or 2% Greek yogurt. ~17 g protein per 170 g (6 oz) serving, naturally high in casein for slow digestion. Excellent as a snack, mixed with fruit, or as a base for sauces. Choose Greek yogurt over regular yogurt for double the protein at similar calories. Choose this over [casein protein](#casein-protein) powder when you want a whole food source before bed. Flavored varieties removed: 15-20 g added sugar per serving defeats the purpose.

### Whey Protein

Whey protein isolate or concentrate powder. ~25 g protein per scoop with the fastest digestion rate of any protein source. Leucine content is the highest of any commercially available protein (~11% by weight). Use it to hit daily protein targets when whole food is impractical -- in a shake, mixed into [oats](#oats), or blended with [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt). This is a convenience, not a superfood. Whey isolate is lower in lactose for those with mild intolerance. Choose whey for speed and convenience. Choose whole food sources for satiety and micronutrients. Plant-based protein powders are a viable alternative but require ~30% more volume per serving to match the leucine content.

### Salmon

Wild-caught or farmed Atlantic salmon. ~25 g protein and ~13 g fat per 100 g (cooked), with the highest omega-3 (EPA/DHA) content of any common protein source. The combination of protein and anti-inflammatory fats makes this the single most nutritionally complete protein food. Eat it 2-3 times per week. Choose salmon over [chicken breast](#chicken-breast) when omega-3 intake is a priority and the higher fat content fits your macros. Wild vs. farmed: wild has slightly better omega-3 ratios; farmed is cheaper and still excellent.

### Lean Beef

93% lean ground beef or sirloin cuts. ~26 g protein and ~6 g fat per 100 g (cooked). The best dietary source of iron (heme iron, which is 2-3x more bioavailable than plant iron), zinc, and B12. If you eat red meat, 2-3 servings per week covers most micronutrient gaps. Choose lean beef when iron and zinc are priorities (especially for women and those with low energy). Choose [chicken breast](#chicken-breast) for a leaner option. Fattier cuts (80/20 ground beef, ribeye) removed from the default rotation: double the fat at similar protein, making macro targets harder to hit.

### Casein Protein

Casein protein powder. ~24 g protein per scoop with a much slower digestion rate than [whey](#whey-protein) -- it forms a gel in the stomach, providing a sustained amino acid release over 6-8 hours. This makes it the best protein supplement before bed, maintaining positive protein balance through the overnight fast. [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt) is the whole-food equivalent (naturally ~80% casein). Choose casein over whey specifically for the pre-sleep meal. Choose whey for all other timing.

### Cottage Cheese

Low-fat cottage cheese. ~14 g protein per 1/2 cup, high in casein like [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt). Versatile as a snack, mixed with fruit, or added to savory dishes. Choose this when you want a high-protein, low-effort food with slow-digesting properties. Less palatable than Greek yogurt for most people, but some prefer the texture.

### Canned Tuna

Chunk light tuna in water. ~20 g protein and <1 g fat per 85 g can. Extremely lean and shelf-stable. Limit to 2-3 cans per week due to mercury content (chunk light has less mercury than albacore). Choose canned tuna for convenience and cost. Choose [salmon](#salmon) for omega-3s and fewer mercury concerns.

## Carbohydrate Sources

### White Rice

Long-grain white rice. ~45 g carbs per cup (cooked) with minimal fat and easy digestion. The default carbohydrate for athletes because it is calorie-dense, cheap, easy to [batch cook](#batch-cooking), and causes almost no digestive distress. Choose white rice over brown rice -- brown rice has marginally more fiber and micronutrients but is harder to digest, slower to cook, and the micronutrient difference is negligible if you eat vegetables. Brown rice removed from the default: the fiber and nutrient differences do not justify the lower digestibility and palatability.

### Oats

Rolled or steel-cut oats. ~54 g carbs per cup (dry) with 10 g protein and 5 g fiber. The best breakfast carbohydrate -- slow-digesting, satiating, and mixes well with [whey protein](#whey-protein), fruit, and nut butter. Steel-cut oats have a lower glycemic index but take longer to cook; rolled oats are the practical default. Instant oats removed: over-processed with added sugars and lower satiety.

### Potatoes

White or yellow potatoes. ~37 g carbs per medium potato with essentially no fat. The most satiating carbohydrate source per calorie (boiled potatoes score the highest on the satiety index of any food tested). Excellent [batch cooking](#batch-cooking) candidate -- boil or bake in bulk. Choose potatoes when satiety matters most (during a cut) or when you want a whole-food carb source with potassium.

### Sweet Potatoes

~24 g carbs per 100 g with high beta-carotene (vitamin A precursor), potassium, and fiber. Slightly more micronutrient-dense than white potatoes but lower in total carbs per weight. Choose sweet potatoes when you want additional micronutrients, or alternate with [white potatoes](#potatoes) for variety. Neither is "better" -- they serve slightly different roles.

### Fruit

Bananas, apples, berries, oranges. Quick-digesting carbohydrates with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water. Eat 1-3 servings daily. Bananas are the best pre/post-workout fruit (fast energy + potassium). Berries have the highest antioxidant density. Fruit does not make you fat -- the fiber and water content make overconsumption difficult. Fruit juice removed: strips the fiber and concentrates the sugar. Eat the whole fruit.

### Rice Cakes

~7 g carbs per cake, essentially zero fat or protein. A rapid-digesting carbohydrate vehicle best used around training. Pair with [peanut butter](#natural-peanut-butter) and a protein source for a quick pre-workout meal. Low satiety on their own -- that is the point around training, when you want fast energy without fullness.

### Pasta

Whole wheat or regular pasta. ~43 g carbs per cup (cooked). A viable carbohydrate source, though denser and more calorie-packed than rice per volume. Choose pasta for variety when you are tired of rice and potatoes. Not inherently worse -- just easier to overeat because of caloric density and typical serving sizes.

### Legumes

Lentils, black beans, chickpeas. ~15 g protein and ~40 g carbs per cup (cooked). The best plant-based protein-carb combination, with high fiber (~15 g per cup) and iron. Essential for [vegetarian and vegan](#ethical-and-religious) athletes. The protein is incomplete (low in methionine) but combining with rice creates a complete amino acid profile. Introduce gradually if you do not eat them regularly -- the fiber content can cause digestive discomfort initially. Choose legumes when you need protein and carbs in one food, especially on a budget.

## Fat Sources

### Olive Oil

Extra virgin olive oil. 14 g fat per tablespoon, predominantly monounsaturated (oleic acid). The best cooking and dressing oil for health -- high in polyphenols, anti-inflammatory, and supported by extensive cardiovascular research. Use for medium-heat cooking and salad dressings. Choose olive oil as the default cooking fat over vegetable/seed oils.

Seed oils (canola, soybean, sunflower) removed from the default: high omega-6 content skews the omega-6:omega-3 ratio. They are not poison, but olive oil is superior on every metric.

### Avocado

~15 g fat per avocado, predominantly monounsaturated with high fiber (10 g) and potassium. Excellent fat source that doubles as a whole food with micronutrient density. Add to meals, blend into shakes, or eat on toast. Choose avocado when you need a whole-food fat source with fiber. More expensive than [olive oil](#olive-oil) per gram of fat.

### Natural Peanut Butter

~16 g fat and 7 g protein per 2 tablespoons. Dense in calories (190 per serving), which makes it useful for gaining and dangerous for cutting. Choose natural (ingredients: peanuts, salt) over commercial brands with added sugar and hydrogenated oils. Almond butter is nutritionally similar but more expensive. Choose peanut butter when you need calorie-dense, portable fat+protein. Measure servings during a cut -- eyeballing leads to overestimation.

### Walnuts

~18 g fat per ounce, with the highest omega-3 (ALA) content of any nut. Also provides magnesium and polyphenols. The best snacking nut for omega-3 intake. Note: ALA (plant omega-3) converts to EPA/DHA at only ~5-10%, so walnuts complement but do not replace [fatty fish](#salmon) or [fish oil](#base-supplements).

### Fatty Fish

[Salmon](#salmon), mackerel, sardines. Listed under [Protein Sources](#protein-sources) as well because they serve double duty. The best dietary source of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids. Eat 2-3 servings per week. If budget is a concern, canned sardines are the cheapest source of omega-3s per dollar.

# Cooking and Meal Prep

Nutrition compliance is a logistics problem. The best diet is one you actually follow. Meal prep eliminates daily decision-making and makes hitting targets automatic.

## Batch Cooking

**Cook twice per week.** Sunday and Wednesday evening, spend 60-90 minutes preparing food for the next 3-4 days. This is the single highest-leverage habit for nutrition consistency.

**The template:**
1. **Protein:** Cook 3-4 lbs of [chicken breast](#chicken-breast) (bake at 400F for 22-25 minutes) or brown 2-3 lbs of [lean ground beef](#lean-beef). Season differently: half with salt, pepper, and garlic powder; half with cumin and chili powder for variety.
2. **Carbs:** Make 4-6 cups of [white rice](#white-rice) in a rice cooker. Simultaneously bake 4-6 [potatoes](#potatoes) or [sweet potatoes](#sweet-potatoes).
3. **Vegetables:** Roast 2-3 sheet pans of mixed vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini -- 400F, 20 minutes, toss in [olive oil](#olive-oil) and salt).
4. **Assembly:** Portion into containers: 6-8 oz protein + 1-1.5 cups carbs + 1 cup vegetables per container.

**Total active time:** ~30 minutes of prep, ~30 minutes of passive cooking. Yields 6-8 meals.

**Equipment needed:** A rice cooker, sheet pans, glass storage containers (12-16 oz size), and a food scale. The food scale matters -- eyeballing portions leads to 20-40% calorie miscounting.

## Storage and Reheating

- **Refrigerator:** Cooked chicken, beef, and rice keep for 4 days. Cook twice per week and nothing goes bad.
- **Freezer:** Cooked proteins and grains freeze well for 2-3 months. Batch cook extra and freeze individual portions for weeks when you do not have time to cook.
- **Reheating:** Microwave with a splash of water (prevents drying). Rice benefits from a damp paper towel over the container. Salmon reheats poorly -- eat it fresh or cold in salads.

## Quick Meals

For days when prep fails or you need something fast. Each hits ~40 g protein.

| Meal | Prep Time | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Whey shake + banana + 2 tbsp peanut butter | 2 min | Blend or just shake + eat separately |
| 4 eggs scrambled + toast + fruit | 8 min | The fastest cooked meal |
| Greek yogurt (12 oz) + oats + berries | 3 min | No cooking required |
| Canned tuna + rice cakes + avocado | 3 min | Shelf-stable, no cooking |
| Rotisserie chicken (store-bought) + microwave rice | 2 min | Emergency meal -- always works |

The rotisserie chicken is the ultimate backup plan. Every grocery store sells them. Buy one when your prep fails.

## Seasoning and Flavor

Eating the same foods repeatedly only works if they taste good. Bland chicken and plain rice is a willpower problem, not a nutrition plan.

**Base seasonings (buy these once, they last months):** Salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, chili powder, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes.

**Zero-calorie flavor additions:** Hot sauce, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce (watch sodium if needed), salsa.

**Low-calorie sauces:** Sugar-free BBQ sauce, sriracha, tzatziki (made with [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt)).

**The rotation principle:** Season the same protein two different ways each batch cook. Week 1: half garlic-herb, half cumin-chili. Week 2: half lemon-pepper, half paprika-onion. Same chicken, different meals. This prevents the diet fatigue that causes people to abandon their plan.

## Eating Out

Restaurant meals are not off-limits. They are harder to track accurately because you do not control portions or cooking methods.

**Strategy:** Prioritize protein. Order a grilled protein (chicken, fish, steak) with vegetables and a starch. Ask for sauce on the side. Skip the bread basket. This gets you within striking distance of your macros even without a food scale.

**Fast food:** In an emergency, most fast food chains have a grilled chicken option. Remove the bun if you need to cut carbs. A grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad is not ideal but is far better than skipping the meal entirely.

**Alcohol at restaurants:** See [What to Minimize](#what-to-minimize). If you drink, account for it: 1 beer is ~150 cal, 1 glass of wine is ~125 cal, 1 spirit with mixer is ~100-200 cal. These calories come primarily from alcohol (7 cal/g), which has no nutritional value.

# Factors for Nutrition Decisions

## Body Composition Goals

### Fat Loss (Cutting)

**Calorie target: 12-13 x bodyweight (lb).** This creates a 500-700 calorie daily deficit, yielding ~1 lb of fat loss per week. Slower is better -- faster cuts sacrifice muscle.

**Protein stays at 1 g/lb.** During a deficit, protein is even more important to preserve muscle. Some evidence supports increasing to 1.2 g/lb during aggressive cuts.

**What to reduce:** Drop carbohydrates first (down to 1-1.25 g/lb), then fats (down to 0.3 g/lb minimum). Never reduce protein.

**Duration:** Cut for 8-12 weeks, then return to maintenance for at least 4 weeks (a "diet break") before cutting again. Extended continuous deficits downregulate metabolic rate and hormones.

**Track everything.** During a cut, a food scale and tracking app (MyFitnessPal, Cronometer) are essential. The margin for error is small. What you think is 2 tablespoons of peanut butter is probably 3.

**Expect performance to dip.** Strength may drop 5-10% during a cut. This is normal. Maintain training intensity and volume as long as possible -- reducing volume is a last resort when recovery cannot keep up.

Crash diets (<1,000 calorie deficit) removed: they produce excessive muscle loss, metabolic adaptation, and are unsustainable. Very low calorie diets removed: medically supervised only, not appropriate for trainees.

### Maintenance

**Calorie target: 15-17 x bodyweight (lb).** The range accounts for individual variation in activity level and metabolic rate. Track your weight weekly (same conditions: morning, fasted, after bathroom). If weight is stable over 2-3 weeks, you have found your maintenance.

Maintenance is the default state and where you should spend most of your time. Body recomposition (simultaneously gaining muscle and losing fat) happens at maintenance, especially for beginners and those returning from a break. It is slower than dedicated cutting or bulking but requires no tracking and no dietary stress.

### Muscle Gain (Bulking)

**Calorie target: 18-20 x bodyweight (lb).** A surplus of 300-500 calories daily, yielding ~0.5-1 lb of gain per week. Roughly half will be muscle in a well-designed program; the rest is water, glycogen, and some fat.

**Protein stays at 1 g/lb.** No need to increase during a bulk -- the surplus itself is anabolic.

**Where to add calories:** Increase carbohydrates first (up to 2-2.5 g/lb), then fats. More carbs means more glycogen, better training performance, and a preferential calorie partitioning toward muscle.

**Duration:** Bulk for 12-20 weeks, then reassess. If body fat exceeds a level you are uncomfortable with (a reasonable ceiling is ~18-20% for men, ~28-30% for women), transition to a cut.

"Dirty bulking" (eating whatever, whenever) removed: excessive surplus beyond ~500 cal/day accelerates fat gain without accelerating muscle gain. The rate of muscle growth has a ceiling -- eating more does not raise it. "Clean bulking" is just eating at a controlled surplus with quality food.

## Dietary Restrictions

### Allergies and Intolerances

**Lactose intolerance:** Use whey isolate (minimal lactose), lactose-free dairy, or plant-based protein powder. [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt) is often tolerated because fermentation reduces lactose content.

**Gluten intolerance/Celiac:** [White rice](#white-rice), [potatoes](#potatoes), [oats](#oats) (certified gluten-free), and all whole food protein and fat sources are naturally gluten-free. This diet is already mostly gluten-free by default.

**Egg allergy:** Replace [eggs](#eggs) with additional [chicken breast](#chicken-breast), [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt), or [cottage cheese](#cottage-cheese) for equivalent protein.

### Ethical and Religious

**Vegetarian:** [Eggs](#eggs), [Greek yogurt](#greek-yogurt), [cottage cheese](#cottage-cheese), and [whey protein](#whey-protein) make hitting protein targets straightforward. Add legumes (lentils, chickpeas) and tofu for variety.

**Vegan:** Requires more planning. Combine legumes, tofu, tempeh, seitan, and plant-based protein powders (pea + rice blend for a complete amino acid profile). Total protein intake may need to increase to 1.2 g/lb to compensate for lower leucine density and digestibility. Supplement B12 (mandatory), vitamin D, and omega-3 (algae-based EPA/DHA).

**Halal/Kosher:** The [Base Program](#base-program) works as-is with halal/kosher-certified meat. No structural changes needed.

## Budget and Accessibility

### Cost per Gram of Protein

Buy protein efficiently. Cost varies by region, but the general hierarchy holds:

| Source | Approximate Cost per 30 g Protein | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Whole eggs (bulk) | $0.60-0.90 | Cheapest complete protein |
| Chicken thighs (bone-in) | $0.75-1.00 | Fattier than breast but much cheaper |
| Whey protein (5 lb tub) | $0.80-1.20 | Cost-effective at scale |
| Canned tuna | $0.90-1.20 | Shelf-stable, no cooking |
| Chicken breast (bulk) | $1.00-1.50 | Leaner but pricier than thighs |
| Greek yogurt (large tub) | $1.00-1.50 | Buy the 32 oz tub, not individual cups |
| Cottage cheese | $1.00-1.50 | Comparable to Greek yogurt |
| Lean ground beef | $1.50-2.00 | Buy in bulk, freeze portions |
| Salmon | $2.50-4.00 | Most expensive; 2x/week is sufficient |

Buy in bulk. Buy on sale. Buy frozen (frozen chicken breast and frozen fish are nutritionally identical to fresh and significantly cheaper). Store-brand whey protein is the same product as premium brands in a different bag.

### Grocery Access

If you live in a food desert or have limited grocery options, focus on shelf-stable staples: canned tuna, canned chicken, dried rice, oats, canned beans, peanut butter, whey protein, and frozen vegetables. These cover all macro and micronutrient needs, require minimal refrigeration, and are available at most stores.

## Convenience and Sustainability

### Prep Time

The [batch cooking](#batch-cooking) system requires ~3 hours per week total (two 90-minute sessions). If that is too much, simplify further:

- Use a rice cooker and set it before you leave for work.
- Buy pre-cut frozen vegetables (microwave in bag).
- Buy rotisserie chicken instead of cooking your own.
- Use canned protein (tuna, chicken) when cooking is impossible.

The goal is minimum effective effort. Optimize for consistency over perfection.

### Adherence

The best diet is one you will actually follow for years. If you hate chicken breast, eat [salmon](#salmon) or [lean beef](#lean-beef) instead. If you hate rice, eat [potatoes](#potatoes) or [pasta](#pasta). The [Base Program](#base-program) is a template -- swap equivalent foods freely within the same macro category. What matters is hitting the macro targets, not the specific foods.

**The 80/20 rule:** Hit your macro targets with whole foods 80% of the time. The remaining 20% can be whatever you want. A protein bar, a meal out, dessert -- these do not derail progress if the overall pattern is solid. Rigid all-or-nothing dieting leads to binge-restrict cycles. Flexible dieting with consistent macro targets outperforms "clean eating" dogma in every adherence study.

## Training Synchronization

### Training Day Nutrition

On days you lift or do conditioning:
- Carbohydrates at the high end: 1.5-2 g/lb.
- Meal timing centered around training: [pre-workout meal](#pre-workout) 60-90 min before, [post-workout meal](#post-workout) within 60 min after.
- Hydration increases: add 16-24 oz per training hour.
- Caffeine 30-60 min before if desired (see [Supplements](#supplements)).

### Rest Day Nutrition

On days you do not train:
- Carbohydrates at the low end: 1-1.5 g/lb.
- Protein stays the same: 1 g/lb. Muscle protein synthesis continues for 24-48 hours after training. Rest day protein is not optional.
- Fats can increase slightly to compensate for lower carbs and maintain palatability.
- Hydration baseline: 0.5 oz per lb bodyweight (no training addition).

Rest days are recovery days, not starvation days. Eating too little on rest days impairs the adaptation you trained for.

## Individual Variation

### Metabolic Rate

The calorie multipliers (16x for maintenance, etc.) are starting points. Individual metabolic rates vary by 10-15% due to genetics, thyroid function, NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and muscle mass. Track your weight weekly for 3-4 weeks at the prescribed calories. If weight is not moving as expected, adjust by 200-300 calories and reassess. Do not make adjustments more frequently than every 2-3 weeks -- weight fluctuates daily due to water, sodium, and glycogen.

### Satiety Response

People respond differently to different macronutrient ratios. Some feel full on high-protein, moderate-fat diets. Others need higher carbohydrates to feel satisfied. If constant hunger is a problem:
- Increase protein (most satiating macronutrient per calorie).
- Increase fiber (vegetables, [oats](#oats), [potatoes](#potatoes)).
- Increase meal volume with low-calorie-dense foods (salads, vegetables, broth-based soups).
- Reduce calorie-dense foods that are easy to overeat ([peanut butter](#natural-peanut-butter), nuts, oils).

### Gut Health

If you experience bloating, gas, or digestive discomfort:
- Introduce high-fiber foods gradually (increase by 5 g/week).
- Try [white rice](#white-rice) instead of brown rice or whole grains if grains cause issues.
- Eliminate common irritants one at a time (dairy, gluten, artificial sweeteners) to identify triggers.
- Consider a probiotic (strain-specific, not a generic blend).
- Fermented foods (yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut) support gut microbiome diversity.

If problems persist despite dietary adjustments, see a gastroenterologist. Chronic digestive issues impair nutrient absorption and undermine everything else in this guide.
