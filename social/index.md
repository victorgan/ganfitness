# Base Program

Most adult friendships die from neglect, not conflict. The drift is so slow you won't notice until someone who mattered becomes a stranger. This program prevents that through a small, consistent investment of time.

Do exactly this for 12 weeks before adjusting. Total time commitment is 3-5 hours per week. Social maintenance is not optional overhead -- it is what makes the rest of life work. Exercise selection matters, but not as much as consistency and showing up; the same is true here.

**If you're starting from near zero:** Don't attempt the full program immediately. Start with one weekly in-person hangout and two texts. Build from there. The cadence below is the target, not the entry point. See [Individual History](#individual-history) if social situations cause you significant anxiety.

## Weekly Cadence

| Action | Frequency | Time | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Text or message a close friend | 2x per week | 5 min each | Not "hey." Something specific: a question, a link they'd like, a reaction to something they shared. |
| In-person hangout (1-on-1 or small group) | 1x per week | 1-3 hours | Default to the same day each week so it becomes automatic. |
| Call a family member or long-distance friend | 1x per week | 15-30 min | Walking calls work well -- combine with daily movement. |
| Respond to all pending messages | 1x per week | 15-30 min | Sunday evening. Clear the backlog. A late reply is better than no reply. |
| Wider network touchpoint | 2x per month | 5 min each | A text, forwarding an article. Low effort, high signal. |
| Attend or host a group activity | 1-2x per month | 2-4 hours | Recurring is better than one-off. See [Group Activities](#group-activities). |

**Initiation minimum:** If you are actively trying to expand your social circle, add one new-person interaction per week. This means showing up somewhere regularly where you'll see the same people. See [Initiation](#initiation).

## Relationship Tiers (Base)

You cannot maintain every relationship at the same intensity. Triage is not cold -- it is honest.

| Tier | People | Maintenance | If You Drop Below This |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inner circle** (2-5) | Partner, closest friends, immediate family | Weekly contact. Know what's happening in their life right now. | Cools within months. These people should never be surprised by major news in your life. |
| **Close friends** (5-15) | People you'd call in a crisis | Every 1-2 weeks. Mix of in-person and digital. | Drift begins within 3-6 months. Hardest to rebuild once lost. |
| **Wider network** (15-50) | Friends you enjoy but see less often, friendly colleagues | Monthly touchpoint. Occasional in-person. | They become acquaintances within a year. Normal and not always worth preventing. |
| **Acquaintances** (50-150) | People you recognize and can have a conversation with | Occasional. Events, annual check-ins. | No active maintenance required. Reactivate when relevant. |

## Sample Week

Assumes a working professional with a partner, [training 4-5 days per week](/lift/index.md), and a moderate social circle. Adjust to your life, but keep the structure.

| Day | Social Action | Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Monday | Text a close friend during lunch | 5 min |
| Tuesday | -- | -- |
| Wednesday | Evening hangout with a friend (dinner, activity, walk) | 2 hours |
| Thursday | Text another close friend | 5 min |
| Friday | Call a family member (walking call after work) | 20 min |
| Saturday | Group activity or host something (every other week) | 2-3 hours |
| Sunday | Clear message backlog. One wider-network touchpoint. | 20 min |

Total: roughly 3-5 hours. This is the minimum effective dose. If you have more capacity, spend it on longer hangouts or more initiation activity -- not on more texting. See [how social time fits into weekly planning](/time/index.md).

When you've run this program for 12+ weeks and want to understand the reasoning, adjust the tiers, or address specific challenges, see the [Comprehensive Social Guide](#comprehensive-social-guide) below.

# Comprehensive Social Guide

## Relationship Tiers

The tier system describes reality, not a ranking of human worth. You already have tiers -- you just haven't named them. Naming them lets you allocate attention honestly instead of feeling vaguely guilty about everyone simultaneously.

**Inner circle (2-5 people).** The people whose absence would fundamentally change your life. You share ongoing context with them -- they know what you're worried about this week, not just this year. Maintenance here is not a chore; it's the relationship itself. If weekly contact feels forced with someone in this tier, they may belong in the next one. Most people have 2-3 at any given time, and that is enough.

**Close friends (5-15 people).** You trust them with real information. You'd help them move. You'd visit them in the hospital. These relationships require consistent investment but tolerate more gaps than the inner circle. The danger zone is 3-6 months of silence -- after that, the relationship loses its ease and you both start treating each other like wider-network contacts.

**Wider network (15-50 people).** Enjoyable, sometimes meaningful, but not deep. Former roommates, workout partners, colleagues you actually like. Monthly contact keeps these warm. Letting some lapse is normal -- you don't have infinite time. The value of a wider network is optionality: some of these people will become close friends during life transitions.

**Acquaintances (50-150 people).** You know their name and can hold a conversation. No active maintenance required. These exist naturally from work, hobbies, and proximity.

[Networking as a primary social strategy] removed: treating relationships as a professional asset poisons the well. Genuine friendships produce professional opportunities as a side effect, not as the goal.

## Initiation

Making friends as an adult is harder than as a child for structural reasons, not personal failings. Children have forced repeated exposure (school), low stakes, and social norms that permit direct approach ("want to play?"). Adults must engineer these conditions deliberately.

**Repeated exposure is non-negotiable.** You cannot befriend someone you see once. Join something that meets weekly: a climbing gym, a running club, a board game night, a volunteer shift, a class. The specific activity matters less than the recurrence. Expect 6-8 exposures before anything resembling friendship emerges.

**Be the initiator.** Most people are waiting for someone else to suggest plans. Be the person who suggests plans. "Want to grab coffee after this?" is sufficient. It will feel awkward. Do it anyway. The rejection rate is lower than you think, and the cost of a "no" is zero.

**Settings that work (recurring + same people):**
- Group sports leagues or recurring fitness classes
- Hobby groups with a regular meeting (not one-off workshops)
- Volunteering shifts (same shift, same people)
- Coworking spaces or regular coffee shops
- Religious or community organizations
- Continuing education classes

**What doesn't work as well:**
- Apps designed for friendship (low repeated exposure, high awkwardness)
- Bars and clubs (too loud for conversation, alcohol masks compatibility)
- Large one-off events without a follow-up mechanism
- Online forums alone (can be a starting point but needs to become in-person)

[Large parties as primary social strategy] removed: parties produce many shallow interactions but rarely deepen existing ones. They supplement regular small-group contact, not replace it.

**The ask.** After 3-4 natural encounters, suggest a one-on-one hangout outside the shared context. "I'm going to check out that new ramen place Saturday -- want to come?" is better than "We should hang out sometime." Specific beats vague. A time and place beats an open invitation.

## Deepening

Moving someone from acquaintance to close friend requires escalating vulnerability, shared experience, and consistent follow-through. This is what naturally happens in friendships that develop, made conscious so you can do it deliberately.

**Escalate context.** If you only see someone at one activity, invite them to a second context. Gym friend becomes dinner friend. Work friend becomes weekend friend. Relationships deepen when people see each other in multiple settings because you learn who they actually are, not just who they are in one environment.

**Reciprocal disclosure.** Share something real -- not a trauma dump, but something with mild stakes. "I've been stressed about a career change" or "I've been figuring out how to deal with my parents getting older." If they reciprocate with something real, the friendship is deepening. If they consistently deflect, they may not want to go deeper, and that's fine.

**Follow through on what they tell you.** If someone mentions a job interview, ask about it next time. If they recommend a book, read it (or start it). The bar is low because most people don't do this at all.

**Time investment.** Research suggests roughly 50 hours of shared time to go from acquaintance to casual friend, and 100+ more to reach close friendship. The exact numbers vary, but the point stands: depth is not built in a weekend. Walking, cooking, sitting in the same room working on different things -- all count.

[Forced intimacy] removed: sharing deep secrets early does not accelerate trust. It creates discomfort and obligation. Let depth emerge from repeated, gradually escalating exchanges.

## Maintenance

Maintenance is the unglamorous core of social life. Initiation gets the attention, but maintenance is where relationships live or die.

**What counts:**
- A text that references something specific ("How did the presentation go?")
- A phone call longer than five minutes
- In-person time, any duration
- Sending something relevant to them (article, meme, photo)
- Remembering and acting on what they've told you
- Showing up when it matters (illness, loss, celebration)

**What doesn't count:**
- Liking their social media posts (low signal, feels like maintenance, isn't)
- Group chat messages not directed at anyone specific
- "We should hang out soon" without a specific plan
- Birthday messages sent through automated reminders with no personal content

**Asymmetry is normal.** In most friendships at any given time, one person is doing more reaching out. This rotates. If you're always initiating and they never reciprocate -- not just less frequently, but never -- that's data. See [Pruning](#pruning).

**Maintenance during hard times.** When someone is going through difficulty, the instinct is to withdraw. Resist it. A short "thinking of you" message during a crisis is worth more than a long conversation during calm. Presence matters more than performance. You don't need to fix anything. Social support during difficult periods is one of the strongest buffers against [mental health decline](/mental/index.md).

## Repair

Conflict and drift are different problems requiring different responses.

**Drift** is the more common killer. No one did anything wrong -- life got busy, responses got shorter, months passed. Repairing drift requires nothing more than reaching out honestly. "Hey, I realize we haven't talked in a while. That's on me. How are you?" This works far more often than people expect. Most drifted friends are relieved someone broke the silence.

**Conflict** requires acknowledgment before resolution:

1. Name the issue specifically. "When you [specific behavior], I felt [specific feeling]." Not "You always..." or "You never..."
2. Listen to their perspective without formulating your rebuttal.
3. Identify what you each need going forward.
4. Decide whether you can both provide it.

Not every conflict is resolvable. Some reveal fundamental incompatibilities that friendship can't bridge. That's information, not failure. See [Conflict Resolution](#conflict-resolution) for the full framework.

**Timing matters.** Don't attempt repair when emotions are high. A 24-hour cooling period before a difficult conversation is almost always worth it. Don't attempt repair via text for anything serious -- tone is invisible in text, and misreadings compound the original problem.

**Apology.** A real apology has four parts: what you did, that it was wrong, that you understand why it hurt, and what you'll do differently. "I'm sorry you feel that way" is not an apology. "I'm sorry I cancelled last-minute three times in a row. That was disrespectful of your time, and I understand why you stopped inviting me. I'll commit to plans or say no upfront" is.

## Pruning

Some relationships should end. Not every friendship is meant to last a lifetime, and pretending otherwise traps both people.

**When to let go:**
- The relationship consistently costs more energy than it provides, and this hasn't changed after honest conversation.
- Your values have diverged enough that spending time together requires you to suppress who you are.
- The person is reliably unkind, dismissive, or only present when they need something.
- You've outgrown each other and are maintaining the relationship out of history, not connection.

**How to let go:**
- Usually, you simply stop initiating. No dramatic confrontation needed. The relationship fades on its own. This is not cowardice -- it is the normal lifecycle of many friendships.
- If they ask what happened, be honest but kind. "I've had less bandwidth lately" is acceptable if true. If the real issue is behavioral, decide whether the friendship is worth the repair conversation.
- For situations involving genuine harm (manipulation, boundary violation, abuse), a clear end is appropriate. "I need to step back from this friendship" is a complete sentence.

**Guilt.** You will feel guilty. That doesn't mean you're wrong. Sometimes caring for yourself and caring for others point in different directions.

[Burning bridges] removed: even when ending a relationship, unnecessary cruelty costs you more than it costs them. Keep the door open unless safety requires you to lock it.

# Interaction Patterns Reference

Different interaction formats serve different purposes. Choosing the right one prevents the common failure of doing lots of socializing that doesn't actually feed your relationships.

## One-on-One

The highest-bandwidth format for building trust. No audience, no group dynamics.

**Best for:** Deepening friendships, personal topics, support, repair conversations. The default choice for moving someone from wider network to close friend.

**Watch out for:** Letting it become a one-sided therapy session (imbalanced disclosure), always meeting at the same place (staleness), cancelling and rescheduling until the plan dies.

**Cadence:** Weekly for inner circle, biweekly for close friends. Aim for 60-90 minutes to get past surface conversation.

## Group Activities

Shared experiences that involve doing something together, not just talking. Board games, sports, hiking, cooking, projects.

**Best for:** Meeting new people in low-pressure settings, maintaining wider network efficiently, creating shared memories. Particularly valuable for people who connect better through activity than open-ended conversation.

**Watch out for:** Group size creeping until it becomes a party, letting planning fall on one person until they burn out, expecting deep personal conversation in a group setting.

**Cadence:** 2-4 times per month. Recurring group activities (weekly pickup basketball, monthly dinner party) are far more effective than one-off events because they create the repeated exposure that builds familiarity.

## Shared Meals

Eating together provides natural structure (ordering, eating, paying), a time limit, and a shared sensory experience. The easiest invitation to extend: "Want to grab lunch?" is the lowest-friction social ask. See also [nutrition and meal planning](/nutrition/index.md).

**Best for:** Casual maintenance, transitioning from acquaintance to friend, catching up after time apart, small celebrations.

**Watch out for:** Restaurants so loud you can't hear each other, phones at the table, letting meals replace all other interaction (eating together is necessary but not sufficient for deep friendship).

**Cadence:** Weekly or biweekly standing meal with a friend or small group.

## Physical Activities Together

Working out, hiking, playing sports, going for walks. Conversation flows differently when you're side-by-side and slightly out of breath. [Training with a friend](/lift/index.md) combines social time with exercise so neither feels sacrificed.

**Best for:** People who find face-to-face conversation intense, having difficult conversations (parallel orientation reduces confrontational energy), and combining social time with exercise. Walking is the most underrated social activity.

**Watch out for:** Competitive dynamics overriding the social element, activities so intense conversation is impossible (sprinting together is training, not socializing), mismatched fitness levels creating discomfort.

**Cadence:** Weekly if you can integrate it into your training.

## Digital Communication

Texting, calling, video calls, voice memos. The connective tissue between in-person interactions.

**Best for:** Maintenance between meetups, long-distance friendships, quick touchpoints, sharing things that remind you of someone.

**Watch out for:** Constant low-quality messaging creating a false sense of connection, leaving people on read for weeks, mistaking group chat activity for individual friendship maintenance.

**Cadence:** Texting as needed for inner circle and close friends, with intentional touchpoints per the [Weekly Cadence](#weekly-cadence). Calls weekly for at least one important relationship.

**Hierarchy:** In-person > phone/video call > voice memo > text > social media interaction. Use the highest-bandwidth channel the relationship warrants and logistics allow.

## Hosting

Having people into your home -- dinner parties, game nights, casual hangouts.

**Best for:** Building deeper trust (inviting someone into your space is an act of vulnerability), combining multiple friendships efficiently, creating recurring social anchors. Few people host regularly, so being one gives disproportionate social returns.

**Watch out for:** Overproducing events to the point of stress (a casual dinner is better than a perfect one that never happens), cleaning anxiety preventing you from hosting at all, inviting too many people and turning a gathering into a party where no one connects.

**Cadence:** Monthly or biweekly if you enjoy it. Even once a quarter matters.

[Travel together and working together as distinct categories] removed: travel is a stress test for close friendships (discuss expectations in advance: budget, pace, alone time). Working together reveals character under pressure but risks professional friction. Neither needs its own section -- the principles from other patterns apply.

# Communication Reference

## Active Listening

Active listening is not waiting for your turn to talk. It is a specific set of behaviors that signal engagement and help the other person think more clearly.

**Reflect content.** Briefly restate what they said in your own words. "So you're saying the new job is exciting but you're worried about the commute." This confirms understanding and shows you're processing, not just hearing.

**Reflect emotion.** Name the feeling you're observing. "That sounds really frustrating." People often describe situations without naming what they feel.

**Go deeper, not wider.** "What's the hardest part of that?" is better than "Oh, that reminds me of when I..." Resist the urge to relate their experience back to yourself. There's time for that, but not in the first response.

**Tolerate silence.** When someone pauses, they're often about to say the most important thing. Don't fill the gap.

**Put the phone away.** Not face-down on the table -- in your pocket or bag. Visible phones degrade conversation quality even when nobody touches them.

## Vulnerability and Self-Disclosure

Vulnerability is the mechanism by which acquaintances become friends. The skill is in the graduation.

**Level 1 -- Facts and preferences.** Where you grew up, what you do for work, what you're watching. Low risk. Appropriate for acquaintances.

**Level 2 -- Opinions and mild stakes.** Your actual opinion about something, a goal you're pursuing, a mild frustration. Some risk of judgment. Appropriate for emerging friends.

**Level 3 -- Personal challenges and real feelings.** A struggle, a fear, a failure, something you're proud of but haven't told many people. Appropriate for close friends and people you're actively deepening with.

**Level 4 -- Core identity and deep history.** Formative experiences, deep insecurities, family dynamics. Reserved for inner circle. Requires established trust.

**The rule:** Match or slightly exceed the other person's disclosure level. If they share Level 2, you can go to Level 2 or 3. Jumping from Level 1 to Level 4 creates discomfort regardless of your intentions.

## Conflict Resolution

A framework for addressing problems directly without destroying the relationship.

**Step 1: Identify the actual issue.** Often the surface complaint ("You were late") masks the real one ("I feel like you don't respect my time"). Figure out what you're actually upset about before starting the conversation.

**Step 2: Choose the right time and medium.** Not when either of you is tired, hungry, or in public. In person or by phone, never by text for anything that matters.

**Step 3: Lead with observation, not accusation.** "I noticed X happened" not "You did X." Describe the behavior, then describe its impact on you.

**Step 4: Listen to their perspective.** You may be wrong. They may have context you lack. Even if you're right, understanding their side makes resolution possible.

**Step 5: State what you need going forward.** "I need you to tell me in advance if plans change" is actionable. "I need you to be more considerate" is vague and invites defensiveness.

**Step 6: Accept the outcome.** Sometimes the resolution is mutual understanding. Sometimes it's a behavior change. Sometimes it's the realization that you need different things.

[Passive aggression as conflict strategy] removed: it signals that the issue matters enough to affect your behavior but not enough to discuss honestly. It always makes things worse.

## Boundary Setting

Boundaries are not punishments. They are statements about what you need to function.

**Say no without over-explaining.** "I can't make it Saturday" is complete. You can offer a reason, but you don't owe one. The more you explain, the more you invite negotiation.

**Name the boundary before it's violated.** "I don't check messages after 9 PM" is easier to maintain than retroactively enforcing unspoken rules.

**Hold the boundary.** If you say no and then cave when pressed, you've taught the other person that your no means "ask again." Consistency matters more than any single instance.

**Expect discomfort.** People who benefited from your lack of boundaries will not celebrate when you establish them. This does not mean your boundaries are wrong.

## Asking for Help

Asking for help is one of the strongest signals of trust you can send. It gives the other person an opportunity to demonstrate care. Most people want to help and are waiting to be asked.

**Be specific.** "Can you help me move next Saturday from 10 AM to 2 PM?" not "I'm moving soon, it's really stressful." Specific asks get answered. Vague complaints get sympathy at best.

**Accept help gracefully.** Don't immediately promise to repay or minimize the favor. "Thank you, that really helps" is enough.

**Reciprocate over time, not immediately.** Friendship is not a ledger. If you find yourself keeping score, the relationship may have a deeper problem.

## Giving and Receiving Feedback

Honest feedback is rare and valuable. Most people would rather let a friend persist in a mistake than risk an uncomfortable conversation.

**Giving:** Ask permission first. "Can I share an observation?" respects their autonomy. Focus on behavior, not character. "I've noticed you interrupt people frequently in group settings" not "You're rude." Offer it because you care about them, not because you want to be right.

**Receiving:** Assume good intent until proven otherwise. Say "Thank you, I'll think about that" and actually think about it. The feedback that stings most is usually the most accurate.

# Factors for Social Decisions

Social needs vary by person and by phase of life. The Base Program is a starting template -- the factors below help you calibrate it to your situation.

| Category | Factor | Key Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Energy and Temperament](#energy-and-temperament) | Introversion / Extroversion | How do I recharge, and what drains me? |
| [Energy and Temperament](#energy-and-temperament) | Social Energy Budget | How many social hours per week can I sustain? |
| [Life Stage](#life-stage) | Current Phase | What does my life structure make easy or hard right now? |
| [Life Stage](#life-stage) | Transitions | Am I entering or leaving a phase that reshuffles my social circle? |
| [Social Capacity](#social-capacity) | Relationship Ceiling | How many close relationships can I realistically maintain? |
| [Social Capacity](#social-capacity) | Current Saturation | Am I at capacity, or do I have room for new people? |
| [Geographic Constraints](#geographic-constraints) | Proximity | Who lives close enough for regular in-person contact? |
| [Geographic Constraints](#geographic-constraints) | Long-Distance | Which distant relationships are worth the extra maintenance cost? |
| [Existing Obligations](#existing-obligations) | Work and Family | How much discretionary social time do I actually have? |
| [Existing Obligations](#existing-obligations) | Training and Health | Am I protecting enough time for [physical health](/lift/index.md) alongside social health? |
| [Individual History](#individual-history) | Attachment and Anxiety | Do I have patterns that interfere with healthy connection? |
| [Individual History](#individual-history) | Cultural Context | What social norms shaped my expectations, and do they serve me? |

## Energy and Temperament

Introversion and extroversion are about energy management, not social skill. Introverts spend energy in social settings and recharge alone. Extroverts gain energy from social interaction. Most people are somewhere in between, and the point shifts with stress, sleep, and life phase.

**If you're more introverted:** The Base Program may feel like a lot. Start with the non-negotiables (one in-person hangout, two texts, one call) and build from there. Prioritize depth over breadth -- one long conversation with a close friend will recharge you more than three shallow group events. Protect recovery time after social commitments. Choose formats that give you more control: [one-on-one](#one-on-one), [physical activities together](#physical-activities-together), and [shared meals](#shared-meals) with small groups.

**If you're more extroverted:** The Base Program may feel like a minimum. Your risk is breadth without depth -- many fun interactions, few deep ones. Make sure at least some social time is [one-on-one](#one-on-one) and involves real conversation, not just shared activity.

**Social energy budget.** Track for two weeks: after each social interaction, note whether you feel energized or depleted. This gives you a realistic budget. Most people have 8-15 hours of quality social time per week. Beyond that, presence without engagement is worse than absence.

## Life Stage

Your social needs and capacities change across life stages. What worked at 22 will not work at 35 or 55. Adapting is not failing.

**College and early twenties:** Social life is structurally easy -- proximity, free time, low obligations, shared schedule. The risk is assuming this will continue automatically. It won't. Build the habit of intentional maintenance now.

**Early career (mid-twenties to early thirties):** The first major social disruption. Friends scatter geographically, work absorbs time, romantic partnerships absorb attention. This is where most adult friendships die. The Base Program is designed primarily for this stage.

**Partnership and early parenthood:** Social circles contract sharply. Time becomes scarce. Maintaining individual friendships -- not just couple friendships -- is critical for both partners. Even one weekly hangout and two texts prevent the total isolation that new parents often experience.

**Mid-life (forties and fifties):** Social networks stabilize but can calcify. The risk is a comfortable but narrow circle. Intentional initiation becomes important again, especially after divorce, relocation, or career change.

**Later life:** Social isolation is one of the strongest predictors of cognitive decline and mortality in older adults. Regular contact and in-person time becomes a [health intervention](/mental/index.md), not just quality-of-life.

## Social Capacity

Dunbar's number (roughly 150) describes the cognitive limit of people you can maintain a social relationship with. The more useful numbers are the inner layers: about 5 in your closest circle, 15 in the next, 50 in the next. These are averages -- yours may differ.

**Signs you're over capacity:** Dreading social commitments, cancelling frequently, feeling relieved when plans fall through, interactions feeling performative. The solution is not to push through -- it's to reduce active relationships and let some move to a lower tier.

**Signs you're under capacity:** Loneliness, feeling like you have no one to call, over-reliance on a single relationship (usually a partner), spending most free time alone by default rather than by choice. The solution is initiation -- see [Initiation](#initiation).

**Capacity is not fixed.** It changes with life stage, [mental health](/mental/index.md), work demands, and energy. Recalibrate quarterly. A season of reduced social capacity is fine; a decade of isolation is not.

[Maximizing total friend count] removed: relationship quality matters more than quantity. Three close friends who know you well will do more for your mental health than thirty acquaintances.

## Geographic Constraints

Physical proximity is the strongest predictor of friendship formation and maintenance. In-person interaction is higher-bandwidth than any digital substitute.

**Local relationships** should get the bulk of your maintenance energy. If you don't have enough local friends, that is the most important gap to fill. See [Initiation](#initiation).

**Long-distance friendships** are worth maintaining but require deliberate effort. Monthly calls, scheduled video hangouts, and annual in-person visits are the minimum to keep a long-distance close friendship alive. Accept that some will naturally drift to the wider network tier.

**After a move:** Your social life resets to near zero. This is normal and temporary, but only if you take active steps. The first six months should involve heavy initiation activity -- multiple recurring group commitments, saying yes to most invitations, and accepting that you'll feel awkward and lonely before you feel settled.

[Maintaining all pre-move friendships at the same level] removed: some will become long-distance close friends, most will drift, a few will fade entirely. Focus your limited long-distance energy on the 3-5 relationships that matter most.

## Existing Obligations

Social time competes with work, family, [training](/lift/index.md), rest, and personal interests. The solution is not to sacrifice everything else -- it's to integrate.

**Integration strategies:**
- Walking calls during commute or exercise time (social + movement)
- [Training with a friend](/lift/index.md) (social + fitness)
- Family meals that include friends occasionally (family + wider network)
- Working alongside a friend in silence at a coffee shop (presence without energy cost)
- Group activities that align with hobbies (social + personal interest)

**Protecting social time.** If you [schedule training](/time/index.md), you should also schedule social commitments. Put the weekly hangout on the calendar. Treat it with the same seriousness as a workout. If you consistently skip social commitments in favor of work or training, the problem is prioritization, not time.

[Filling every free hour with social commitments] removed: rest and solitude are not wasted time. The goal is consistent, sustainable connection -- not a packed social calendar. Protecting unscheduled time is as important as scheduling social time.

## Individual History

Some people find social connection naturally easy. Others find it terrifying, confusing, or exhausting in ways that go beyond introversion. This section is about recognizing when your history is affecting your present.

**Attachment patterns.** If you consistently push people away when they get close, cling to relationships out of fear of abandonment, or avoid intimacy entirely, these patterns often trace back to early relationships and can be addressed with professional help. Recognizing the pattern is the first step; a therapist who works with attachment is the most effective next step.

**Social anxiety.** If the thought of attending a group event or making a phone call produces physical anxiety, the Base Program may feel impossible. Start smaller: one text per week, one brief in-person interaction. Consider whether the anxiety is situational (normal nervousness in new settings) or pervasive (interfering with daily functioning). The latter warrants professional support -- therapy, particularly CBT or exposure-based approaches, has strong evidence for social anxiety. See also [mental health support](/mental/index.md).

**Neurodivergence.** ADHD, autism, and other neurodevelopmental differences affect social interaction in specific ways -- difficulty reading social cues, challenges with executive function around planning and follow-through, sensory overwhelm in group settings. The Base Program's structure (specific actions, specific frequencies) may help by externalizing what neurotypical people do intuitively. Adapt the formats to your strengths: if phone calls are hard, use voice memos. If group settings are overwhelming, prioritize one-on-one. The goal is connection, not conformity to neurotypical social norms.

**Chronic illness and disability.** Conditions that limit energy, mobility, or predictability make the Base Program's cadence unrealistic at times. Adapt the format, not the intent: if you can't leave the house, a video call counts. If your energy is unpredictable, have a standing open invitation with a close friend rather than fixed plans that produce guilt when cancelled. The people worth keeping will accommodate fluctuation when you communicate honestly about what you need.

**Cultural context.** Social norms around friendship vary enormously across cultures -- expectations about directness, physical affection, frequency of contact, the role of family versus friends, and how conflict is handled. If you grew up in a different cultural context than the one you currently live in, mismatches are inevitable. Explicitly discussing expectations ("In my family, we call every day -- I know that's not everyone's norm") prevents misunderstandings.

**When to get help.** If you are consistently unable to form or maintain relationships despite genuine effort, or if social situations cause significant distress, or if you recognize patterns you can't change on your own, [talk to a therapist](/mental/index.md). Social connection is a fundamental need, and sometimes the wiring needs professional attention.
