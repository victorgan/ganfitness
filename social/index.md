# Base Program

Most adult friendships die from neglect, not conflict. People assume good relationships maintain themselves. They do not. The drift is so slow you won't notice until someone who mattered becomes a stranger. This program prevents that drift through a small, consistent investment of time.

Do exactly this for 12 weeks before adjusting. The total time commitment is 3-5 hours per week, which sounds like a lot until you realize you probably spend that much scrolling through content that makes you feel worse. Social maintenance is not optional overhead -- it is the thing that makes the rest of life bearable.

**If you're starting from near zero:** Don't attempt the full program immediately. Start with the one weekly in-person hangout and two texts. Build from there. The cadence below is the target, not the entry point. See [Individual History](#individual-history) if social situations cause you significant anxiety.

## Weekly Cadence

| Action | Frequency | Time | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Text or message a close friend | 2x per week | 5 min each | Not "hey." Something specific: a question, a link they'd like, a reaction to something they shared. |
| In-person hangout (1-on-1 or small group) | 1x per week | 1-3 hours | Default to the same day each week so it becomes automatic. |
| Call a family member or long-distance friend | 1x per week | 15-30 min | Walking calls work well -- combine with your daily movement. |
| Respond to all pending messages | 1x per week | 15-30 min | Sunday evening. Clear the backlog. A late reply is better than no reply. |
| Wider network touchpoint | 2x per month | 5 min each | A text, a comment, forwarding an article. Low effort, high signal. |
| Attend or host a group activity | 1-2x per month | 2-4 hours | Recurring is better than one-off. See [Group Activities](#group-activities). |

**Initiation minimum:** If you are actively trying to expand your social circle, add one new-person interaction per week. This means showing up somewhere regularly where you'll see the same people. See [Initiation](#initiation).

## Relationship Tiers (Base)

You cannot maintain every relationship at the same intensity. Triage is not cold -- it is honest.

| Tier | People | Maintenance | If You Drop Below This |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inner circle** (2-5 people) | Partner, closest friends, immediate family | Weekly contact. See or call regularly. Know what's happening in their life right now. | The relationship will cool within months. These people should never be surprised by major news in your life. |
| **Close friends** (5-15 people) | People you'd call in a crisis, friends who know your real problems | Every 1-2 weeks. Mix of in-person and digital. | Drift begins within 3-6 months. Hardest to rebuild once lost. |
| **Wider network** (15-50 people) | Friends you enjoy but see less often, former close friends, friendly colleagues | Monthly touchpoint. Occasional in-person. | They become acquaintances within a year. This is normal and not always worth preventing. |
| **Acquaintances** (50-150 people) | People you recognize and can have a conversation with | Occasional. Events, social media, annual check-ins. | No active maintenance required. Reactivate when relevant. |

## Sample Week

This assumes a working professional with a partner, training 4-5 days per week, and a moderate social circle. Adjust to your life, but keep the structure.

| Day | Social Action | Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Monday | Text a close friend during lunch | 5 min |
| Tuesday | -- | -- |
| Wednesday | Evening hangout with a friend (dinner, activity, walk) | 2 hours |
| Thursday | Text another close friend | 5 min |
| Friday | Call a family member (walking call after work) | 20 min |
| Saturday | Group activity or host something (every other week) | 2-3 hours |
| Sunday | Clear message backlog. One wider-network touchpoint. | 20 min |

Total: roughly 3-5 hours. This is the minimum effective dose. If you have more capacity, spend it on longer hangouts or more initiation activity -- not on more texting.

When you've run this program for 12+ weeks and want to understand the reasoning, adjust the tiers, or address specific challenges, see the [Comprehensive Social Guide](#comprehensive-social-guide) below.

# Comprehensive Social Guide

## Relationship Tiers

The tier system is a description of reality, not a ranking of human worth. You already have tiers -- you just haven't named them. Naming them lets you allocate attention honestly instead of feeling vaguely guilty about everyone simultaneously.

**Inner circle (2-5 people).** These are the people whose absence would fundamentally change your life. You share ongoing context with them -- they know what you're worried about this week, not just this year. Maintenance here is not a chore; it's the relationship itself. If weekly contact feels forced with someone in this tier, they may belong in the next one. Five is a soft ceiling. Most people have 2-3 at any given time, and that is enough.

**Close friends (5-15 people).** You trust them with real information. You'd help them move. You'd visit them in the hospital. These relationships require consistent investment but tolerate more gaps than the inner circle. The danger zone is 3-6 months of silence -- after that, the relationship loses its ease and you both start treating each other like wider-network contacts.

**Wider network (15-50 people).** Enjoyable, sometimes meaningful, but not deep. Former roommates, workout partners, colleagues you actually like. Monthly contact is enough to keep these warm. Letting some of these lapse is normal and necessary -- you don't have infinite time. The value of a wider network is optionality: some of these people will become close friends during life transitions.

**Acquaintances (50-150 people).** You know their name and can hold a conversation. No active maintenance required. These exist naturally from work, hobbies, and proximity. Don't invest guilt here.

[Networking as a primary social strategy] removed: treating relationships as a professional asset poisons the well. Genuine friendships produce professional opportunities as a side effect, not as the goal.

## Initiation

Making friends as an adult is harder than as a child for structural reasons, not personal failings. Children have forced repeated exposure (school), low stakes (no mortgages to discuss), and social norms that permit direct approach ("want to play?"). Adults must engineer these conditions deliberately.

**Repeated exposure is non-negotiable.** You cannot befriend someone you see once. Join something that meets weekly: a climbing gym, a running club, a board game night, a volunteer shift, a class. The specific activity matters less than the recurrence. Aim for 6-8 exposures before expecting anything resembling friendship.

**Be the initiator.** Most people are waiting for someone else to suggest plans. Be the person who suggests plans. "Want to grab coffee after this?" is sufficient. It will feel awkward. Do it anyway. The rejection rate is lower than you think, and the cost of a "no" is zero.

**Proximity-based settings that work:**
- Recurring fitness classes or group sports leagues
- Hobby groups with a regular meeting (not one-off workshops)
- Volunteering shifts (same shift, same people)
- Coworking spaces or regular coffee shops
- Religious or community organizations
- Continuing education classes

**What doesn't work as well:**
- Apps designed for friendship (low repeated exposure, high awkwardness)
- Bars and clubs (too loud for conversation, alcohol masks compatibility)
- Large one-off events (concerts, festivals) without a follow-up mechanism
- Online forums alone (can be a starting point but needs to become in-person)

[Large parties as primary social strategy] removed: parties produce many shallow interactions but rarely deepen existing ones. They work as a supplement to regular small-group contact, not as a replacement.

**The ask.** After 3-4 natural encounters, suggest a one-on-one hangout outside the shared context. "I'm going to check out that new ramen place Saturday -- want to come?" is better than "We should hang out sometime." Specific beats vague. A time and place beats an open invitation.

## Deepening

Moving someone from acquaintance to close friend requires escalating vulnerability, shared experience, and consistent follow-through. This is not a manipulation technique -- it is what naturally happens in friendships that develop, made conscious so you can do it intentionally.

**Escalate context.** If you only see someone at one activity, invite them to a second context. Gym friend becomes dinner friend. Work friend becomes weekend friend. Relationships deepen when people see each other in multiple settings because you learn who they actually are, not just who they are in one environment.

**Reciprocal disclosure.** Share something real about yourself -- not a trauma dump, but something with mild stakes. "I've been stressed about a career change" or "I've been figuring out how to deal with my parents getting older." If they reciprocate with something real, the friendship is deepening. If they consistently deflect, they may not want to go deeper, and that's fine.

**Follow through on what they tell you.** If someone mentions a job interview, ask about it next time you see them. If they recommend a book, read it (or at least start it). The bar is remarkably low because most people don't do this at all.

**Time investment.** Research suggests roughly 50 hours of shared time to go from acquaintance to casual friend, and 100+ more hours to reach close friendship. The exact numbers vary, but the point stands: depth is not built in a weekend. It's a slow accumulation. The hours don't need to be intense -- walking, cooking, sitting in the same room working on different things all count.

[Forced intimacy] removed: sharing deep secrets early does not accelerate trust. It creates discomfort and obligation. Let depth emerge from repeated, gradually escalating exchanges.

## Maintenance

Maintenance is the unglamorous core of social life. Initiation gets the attention, but maintenance is where relationships actually live or die.

**What counts as maintenance:**
- A text that references something specific ("How did the presentation go?")
- A phone call longer than five minutes
- In-person time, any duration
- Sending something relevant to them (article, meme, photo)
- Remembering and acting on what they've told you
- Showing up when it matters (illness, loss, celebration)

**What doesn't count:**
- Liking their social media posts (low signal, feels like maintenance, isn't)
- Group chat messages not directed at anyone specific
- "We should hang out soon" without a specific plan
- Birthday messages sent through automated reminders with no personal content

**Asymmetry is normal.** In most friendships at any given time, one person is doing more reaching out. This rotates. If you're always initiating and they never reciprocate -- not just less frequently, but never -- that's data. See [Pruning](#pruning).

**Maintenance during hard times.** When you or someone else is going through difficulty, the instinct is to withdraw. Resist this on both sides. A short "thinking of you" message during someone's crisis is worth more than a long conversation during calm. Presence matters more than performance. You don't need to fix anything.

## Repair

Conflict and drift are different problems requiring different responses.

**Drift** is the more common killer. No one did anything wrong. Life got busy, responses got shorter, months passed. Repairing drift requires nothing more than reaching out honestly. "Hey, I realize we haven't talked in a while. That's on me. How are you?" This works far more often than people expect. Most drifted friends are relieved someone broke the silence.

**Conflict** requires acknowledgment before resolution. The framework:

1. Name the issue specifically. "When you [specific behavior], I felt [specific feeling]." Not "You always..." or "You never..."
2. Listen to their perspective without formulating your rebuttal.
3. Identify what you each need going forward.
4. Decide whether you can both provide it.

Not every conflict is resolvable. Some reveal fundamental incompatibilities that friendship can't bridge. That's not a failure -- it's information. See [Conflict Resolution](#conflict-resolution) for more detail.

**Timing matters.** Don't attempt repair when emotions are still high. A 24-hour cooling period before a difficult conversation is almost always worth it. Don't attempt repair via text for anything serious -- tone is invisible in text, and misreadings compound the original problem.

**Apology.** A real apology has four parts: what you did, that it was wrong, that you understand why it hurt, and what you'll do differently. "I'm sorry you feel that way" is not an apology. "I'm sorry I cancelled last-minute three times in a row. That was disrespectful of your time, and I understand why you stopped inviting me. I'll commit to plans or say no upfront" is.

## Pruning

Some relationships should end. Not every friendship is meant to last a lifetime, and pretending otherwise traps you in obligations that drain both people.

**When to let go:**
- The relationship consistently costs more energy than it provides, and this hasn't changed after honest conversation.
- Your values have diverged to the point where spending time together requires you to suppress who you are.
- The person is reliably unkind, dismissive, or only present when they need something.
- You've outgrown each other and are maintaining the relationship out of history, not genuine connection.

**How to let go:**
- Most of the time, you simply stop initiating. No dramatic confrontation needed. The relationship will fade on its own. This is not cowardice -- it is the normal lifecycle of many friendships.
- If they ask what happened, be honest but kind. "I've had less bandwidth lately" is acceptable if true. If the real issue is behavioral, decide whether the friendship is worth the repair conversation. If not, a gentle fade is kinder than a catalog of grievances.
- For situations involving genuine harm (manipulation, boundary violation, abuse), a clear and direct end is appropriate. "I need to step back from this friendship" is a complete sentence.

**Guilt.** You will feel guilty. That's normal and it doesn't mean you're wrong. Guilt is not a reliable indicator of moral failure -- it's an indicator that you're a person who cares about others. Sometimes caring for yourself and caring for others point in different directions.

[Burning bridges] removed: even when ending a relationship, unnecessary cruelty costs you more than it costs them. Keep the door open unless safety requires you to lock it.

# Interaction Patterns Reference

Different interaction formats serve different purposes. Choosing the right format for the right goal prevents the common failure of doing lots of socializing that doesn't actually feed your relationships.

## One-on-One Conversation

The highest-bandwidth interaction for deepening trust and sharing real information. No audience to perform for, no group dynamics to navigate.

**Good for:** Deepening friendships, discussing personal topics, giving or receiving support, repair conversations, getting to know someone new beyond surface level. The default choice for any relationship you're trying to move from wider network to close friend.

**Bad for:** Meeting new people (no shared context to break the ice), maintaining energy with people who drain you (no buffer), and situations where one person dominates (unbalanced dynamics are more visible one-on-one).

**Recommended frequency:** Weekly for inner circle, biweekly for close friends. Aim for at least 60-90 minutes to get past surface conversation.

**Common failure modes:** Letting one-on-ones become therapy sessions (imbalanced disclosure), always meeting in the same place doing the same thing (staleness), cancelling and rescheduling until the plan dies.

## Group Activities

Shared experiences that involve doing something together, not just talking. Board games, sports, hiking, cooking, projects.

**Good for:** Meeting new people in low-pressure settings, maintaining wider network relationships efficiently, creating shared memories, and providing structure for people who find open-ended conversation tiring. Particularly valuable for people who connect better through shared activity than face-to-face dialogue.

**Bad for:** Deep personal conversation (too many people, too much distraction), repair or conflict resolution, and getting to know someone individually (group dynamics can mask who someone actually is).

**Recommended frequency:** 2-4 times per month. Recurring group activities (weekly pickup basketball, monthly dinner party) are far more effective than one-off events because they create the repeated exposure that builds familiarity.

**Common failure modes:** Group size creeping up until it becomes a party, defaulting to the same activity until people get bored, inviting incompatible people and hoping it works out, letting planning fall on one person until they burn out.

## Shared Meals

Eating together is the oldest social technology. It works because it provides natural structure (ordering, eating, paying), a time limit, and a shared sensory experience.

**Good for:** Casual maintenance, transitioning from acquaintance to friend (low-stakes invitation), catching up after time apart, small celebrations. The easiest invitation to extend: "Want to grab lunch?" is the lowest-friction social ask.

**Bad for:** Sensitive conversations in public settings, groups larger than 6 (conversation fragments and some people get stranded), situations where dietary restrictions or financial differences create tension.

**Recommended frequency:** Weekly or biweekly standing meal with a friend or small group. You're already eating -- make some of those meals social.

**Common failure modes:** Choosing restaurants so loud you can't hear each other, always splitting the check in a way that creates resentment, using phones at the table, letting meals replace all other forms of interaction (eating together is necessary but not sufficient for deep friendship).

## Physical Activities Together

Working out, hiking, playing sports, going for walks. Movement-based interaction has a unique quality: conversation flows differently when you're side-by-side and slightly out of breath.

**Good for:** People who find face-to-face conversation intense, building non-verbal rapport, having difficult conversations (the parallel orientation and shared activity reduce confrontational energy), and combining social time with exercise so neither feels sacrificed. Walking is the most underrated social activity.

**Bad for:** People with very different fitness levels (creates an uncomfortable dynamic), activities so intense conversation is impossible (sprinting together is training, not socializing), and situations requiring focused eye-contact conversation.

**Recommended frequency:** Weekly if you can integrate it into your training. The walking conversation should be a staple.

**Common failure modes:** Competitive dynamics overriding the social element, one person always choosing the activity, using the workout as an excuse to avoid actual conversation.

## Digital Communication

Texting, calling, video calls, voice memos. The connective tissue between in-person interactions.

**Good for:** Maintenance between in-person meetups, long-distance friendships, quick low-effort touchpoints, sharing things that remind you of someone, and coordinating plans.

**Bad for:** Deepening relationships past a certain point (it supplements in-person time; it doesn't replace it), conflict resolution (tone is invisible), and creating a false sense of connection through constant low-quality messaging.

**Recommended frequency:** Texting: as needed for inner circle and close friends, with intentional touchpoints per the [Weekly Cadence](#weekly-cadence). Calls: weekly for at least one important relationship. Video calls: good for long-distance close friends, awkward for acquaintances.

**Common failure modes:** Responding with one-word messages that signal disinterest, letting conversations die because neither person sends a substantive reply, mistaking group chat activity for individual friendship maintenance, leaving people on read for weeks.

**Hierarchy:** In-person > phone/video call > voice memo > text > social media interaction. Use the highest-bandwidth channel the relationship warrants and logistics allow.

## Hosting

Having people into your home. Dinner parties, game nights, casual hangouts, holiday gatherings.

**Good for:** Building deeper trust (inviting someone into your space is an act of vulnerability), combining multiple friendships efficiently, creating recurring social anchors, and exercising generosity. Being a host is one of the highest-value social skills because everyone benefits and few people do it.

**Bad for:** Relationships you're unsure about (your home is your space -- don't invite obligation), people-pleasing situations where you overcommit and resent it, and early-stage friendships where the intimacy of a home visit feels premature.

**Recommended frequency:** Monthly or biweekly if you enjoy it. Even once a quarter matters.

**Common failure modes:** Overproducing events to the point of stress (a casual dinner is better than a perfect one that never happens), never reciprocating when others host, inviting too many people and turning a gathering into a party where no one connects, cleaning anxiety preventing you from hosting at all.

## Travel Together

Extended time in unfamiliar territory. The stress test and accelerant of relationships.

**Good for:** Rapidly deepening friendships (more shared hours in a few days than months of regular contact), revealing true compatibility under stress, creating intense shared memories.

**Bad for:** New or untested friendships (travel with someone you haven't spent a full day with is a gamble), people with very different travel styles (planner vs. improviser, budget vs. luxury), and situations where you can't have your own space when needed.

**Recommended frequency:** 1-2 trips per year with close friends, if feasible. A weekend trip is enough to test compatibility without overcommitting.

**Common failure modes:** Not discussing expectations in advance (budget, pace, alone time), one person planning everything while others passively consume the itinerary, conflict avoidance during the trip followed by resentment after, assuming travel compatibility equals life compatibility.

## Working Together

Collaboration on projects, work partnerships, creative endeavors, or practical tasks (helping someone move, building something).

**Good for:** Revealing character under pressure, building mutual respect, creating shared accomplishment, and learning how someone thinks and solves problems. Some of the deepest friendships form through shared struggle.

**Bad for:** Situations where power dynamics are unequal (boss-employee friendships have inherent limits), projects where stakes are high and abilities are mismatched, and relationships you want to protect from professional friction.

**Recommended frequency:** Opportunistic. Don't manufacture projects, but don't avoid collaboration out of fear either.

**Common failure modes:** Letting work disagreements become personal, unclear role division creating resentment, one person doing most of the work, and confusing professional respect for personal friendship.

# Communication Reference

## Active Listening

Active listening is not "sit quietly and wait for your turn to talk." It is a specific set of behaviors that signal genuine engagement and help the other person think more clearly.

**Reflect content.** Briefly restate what they said in your own words. "So you're saying the new job is exciting but you're worried about the commute." This confirms understanding and shows you're processing, not just hearing.

**Reflect emotion.** Name the feeling you're observing. "That sounds really frustrating." People often describe situations without naming what they feel, and hearing the emotion named can be clarifying for them.

**Ask follow-up questions that go deeper, not wider.** "What's the hardest part of that?" is better than "Oh, that reminds me of when I..."  Resist the urge to relate their experience back to yourself. There's time for that, but not in the first response.

**Tolerate silence.** When someone pauses, they're often about to say the most important thing. Don't fill the gap. Count to five internally before speaking.

**Put the phone away.** Not face-down on the table. In your pocket or bag. Visible phones degrade conversation quality even when nobody touches them.

## Vulnerability and Self-Disclosure

Vulnerability is the mechanism by which acquaintances become friends. It is also the mechanism by which you get hurt. The skill is in the graduation.

**Level 1 -- Facts and preferences.** Where you grew up, what you do for work, what you're watching. Low risk, low reward. Appropriate for acquaintances and early encounters.

**Level 2 -- Opinions and mild stakes.** Your actual opinion about something, a goal you're pursuing, a mild frustration. Some risk of judgment. Appropriate for emerging friends.

**Level 3 -- Personal challenges and real feelings.** A struggle you're going through, a fear, a failure, something you're proud of but haven't told many people. Real vulnerability. Appropriate for close friends and people you're actively deepening with.

**Level 4 -- Core identity and deep history.** Formative experiences, deep insecurities, family dynamics, things that shaped who you are. Reserved for inner circle. This level requires established trust.

**The rule:** Match or slightly exceed the other person's disclosure level. If they share Level 2, you can go to Level 2 or 3. Jumping from Level 1 to Level 4 creates discomfort regardless of your intentions.

## Conflict Resolution

A framework for addressing problems directly without destroying the relationship.

**Step 1: Identify the actual issue.** Often the surface complaint ("You were late") masks the real one ("I feel like you don't respect my time"). Figure out what you're actually upset about before starting the conversation.

**Step 2: Choose the right time and medium.** Not when either of you is tired, hungry, or in public. In person or by phone, never by text for anything that matters.

**Step 3: Lead with observation, not accusation.** "I noticed X happened" not "You did X." Describe the behavior, then describe its impact on you.

**Step 4: Listen to their perspective.** You may be wrong. They may have context you lack. Even if you're right, understanding their side makes resolution possible.

**Step 5: State what you need going forward.** "I need you to tell me in advance if plans change" is actionable. "I need you to be more considerate" is vague and invites defensiveness.

**Step 6: Accept the outcome.** Sometimes the resolution is that you both understand each other better. Sometimes it's a behavior change. Sometimes it's the realization that you need different things. All of these are valid outcomes.

[Passive aggression as conflict strategy] removed: it signals that the issue matters enough to affect your behavior but not enough to discuss honestly. It always makes things worse.

## Boundary Setting

Boundaries are not punishments. They are statements about what you need to function. Setting them is uncomfortable and necessary.

**Say no without over-explaining.** "I can't make it Saturday" is complete. You can offer a reason, but you don't owe one. The more you explain, the more you invite negotiation.

**Name the boundary before it's violated.** "I don't check messages after 9 PM" is easier to maintain than retroactively enforcing unspoken rules.

**Hold the boundary.** If you say no and then cave when pressed, you've taught the other person that your no means "ask again." Consistency matters more than any single instance.

**Expect discomfort.** People who benefited from your lack of boundaries will not celebrate when you establish them. This does not mean your boundaries are wrong.

## Asking for Help

Asking for help is not weakness. It is one of the strongest signals of trust you can send, and it gives the other person an opportunity to demonstrate care. Most people want to help and are waiting to be asked.

**Be specific.** "Can you help me move next Saturday from 10 AM to 2 PM?" not "I'm moving soon, it's really stressful." Specific asks get answered. Vague complaints get sympathy at best.

**Accept help gracefully.** Don't immediately promise to repay or minimize the favor. "Thank you, that really helps" is enough.

**Reciprocate over time, not immediately.** Friendship is not a ledger. The reciprocation happens across months and years, not transaction by transaction. If you find yourself keeping score, the relationship may have a deeper problem.

## Giving and Receiving Feedback

Honest feedback is rare and valuable. Most people would rather let a friend persist in a mistake than risk an uncomfortable conversation. Being willing to give and receive honest feedback is a hallmark of close friendship.

**Giving:** Ask permission first. "Can I share an observation?" respects their autonomy. Be specific and focus on behavior, not character. "I've noticed you interrupt people frequently in group settings" not "You're rude." Offer it because you care about them, not because you want to be right.

**Receiving:** Assume good intent until proven otherwise. Don't respond immediately -- say "Thank you, I'll think about that" and actually think about it. The feedback that stings most is usually the feedback that's most accurate.

# Factors for Social Decisions

Social needs vary by person and by phase of life. The Base Program is a starting template -- the factors below help you calibrate it to your situation.

| Category | Factor | Key Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Energy and Temperament](#energy-and-temperament) | Introversion / Extroversion | How do I recharge, and what drains me? |
| [Energy and Temperament](#energy-and-temperament) | Social Energy Budget | How many social hours per week can I sustain before quality drops? |
| [Life Stage](#life-stage) | Current Phase | What does my life structure make easy or hard right now? |
| [Life Stage](#life-stage) | Transitions | Am I entering or leaving a phase that reshuffles my social circle? |
| [Social Capacity](#social-capacity) | Relationship Ceiling | How many close relationships can I realistically maintain? |
| [Social Capacity](#social-capacity) | Current Saturation | Am I at capacity, or do I have room for new people? |
| [Geographic Constraints](#geographic-constraints) | Proximity | Who lives close enough for regular in-person contact? |
| [Geographic Constraints](#geographic-constraints) | Long-Distance | Which distant relationships are worth the extra maintenance cost? |
| [Existing Obligations](#existing-obligations) | Work and Family | How much discretionary social time do I actually have? |
| [Existing Obligations](#existing-obligations) | Training and Health | Am I protecting enough time for physical health alongside social health? |
| [Individual History](#individual-history) | Attachment and Anxiety | Do I have patterns that interfere with healthy connection? |
| [Individual History](#individual-history) | Cultural Context | What social norms shaped my expectations, and do they serve me? |

## Energy and Temperament

Introversion and extroversion are about energy management, not social skill. Introverts are not bad at socializing; they spend energy in social settings and recharge alone. Extroverts gain energy from social interaction and drain in solitude. Most people are somewhere in between, and the point on the spectrum shifts with stress, sleep, and life phase.

**If you're more introverted:** The Base Program may feel like a lot. Start with the non-negotiables (one in-person hangout, two texts, one call) and build from there. Prioritize depth over breadth. One long conversation with a close friend will recharge you more than three shallow group events. Protect recovery time after social commitments -- back-to-back social days will deplete you. Choose interaction formats that give you more control: [one-on-one conversation](#one-on-one-conversation), [physical activities together](#physical-activities-together), and [shared meals](#shared-meals) with small groups.

**If you're more extroverted:** The Base Program may feel like a minimum. The risk for you is breadth without depth -- many fun interactions, few deep ones. Make sure at least some of your social time is [one-on-one](#one-on-one-conversation) and involves real conversation, not just shared activity. You may also need to develop comfort with solitude, which is a skill, not a deficiency.

**Social energy budget.** Track for two weeks: after each social interaction, note whether you feel energized or depleted, and how long recovery takes. This gives you a realistic budget. Most people have 8-15 hours of quality social time per week. Beyond that, presence without engagement is worse than absence.

## Life Stage

Your social needs and capacities change dramatically across life stages. What worked at 22 will not work at 35 or 55. Adapting is not failing.

**College and early twenties:** Social life is structurally easy -- proximity, free time, low obligations, shared schedule. The main risk is assuming this will continue automatically. It won't. Build the habit of intentional maintenance now.

**Early career (mid-twenties to early thirties):** The first major social disruption. Friends scatter geographically, work absorbs time, romantic partnerships absorb attention. This is where most adult friendships die. The Base Program is designed primarily for this stage. Initiation effort is highest here because you need to rebuild a local network.

**Partnership and early parenthood:** Social circles contract sharply. Time becomes scarce, and couples often socialize as units, which changes the dynamic. Maintaining individual friendships -- not just couple friendships -- is critical for both partners. The Base Program's minimum cadence is especially important here: even one weekly hangout and two texts prevent the total isolation that new parents often experience.

**Mid-life (forties and fifties):** Social networks stabilize but can calcify. The risk is a comfortable but narrow circle that doesn't include new people. Intentional initiation becomes important again, especially if you've experienced divorce, relocation, or career change.

**Later life:** Social isolation is one of the strongest predictors of cognitive decline and mortality in older adults. The Base Program's emphasis on regular contact and in-person time becomes a health intervention, not just a quality-of-life one.

## Social Capacity

Dunbar's number (roughly 150) describes the cognitive limit of people you can maintain a social relationship with. But the more useful number is the inner layers: about 5 people in your closest circle, 15 in the next, and 50 in the next. These numbers are averages -- yours may be higher or lower.

**Signs you're over capacity:** Dreading social commitments, cancelling frequently, feeling relieved when plans fall through, interactions feeling performative. The solution is not to push through -- it's to reduce the number of relationships you're actively maintaining and let some move to a lower tier.

**Signs you're under capacity:** Loneliness, feeling like you have no one to call, over-reliance on a single relationship (usually a partner), and spending most free time alone by default rather than by choice. The solution is initiation -- see [Initiation](#initiation).

**Capacity is not fixed.** It changes with life stage, mental health, work demands, and energy. Recalibrate quarterly. A season of reduced social capacity is fine; a decade of isolation is not.

[Maximizing total friend count] removed: the research on well-being consistently shows that relationship quality matters more than quantity. Three close friends who know you well will do more for your mental health than thirty acquaintances. Optimize for depth, not breadth.

## Geographic Constraints

Physical proximity is the strongest predictor of friendship formation and maintenance. This is not a character flaw -- it's physics. In-person interaction is higher-bandwidth than any digital substitute.

**Local relationships** should get the bulk of your maintenance energy. These are the people you can see regularly with minimal planning friction. If you don't have enough local friends, that is the most important gap to fill. See [Initiation](#initiation).

**Long-distance friendships** are worth maintaining but require deliberate effort that local friendships don't. Monthly calls, scheduled video hangouts, and annual in-person visits are the minimum to keep a long-distance close friendship alive. Accept that some long-distance friendships will naturally drift to the wider network tier, and focus your long-distance energy on the ones that matter most.

**After a move:** Your social life resets to near zero. This is normal and temporary, but only if you take active steps. The first six months in a new city should involve heavy initiation activity -- multiple recurring group commitments, saying yes to most invitations, and accepting that you'll feel awkward and lonely before you feel settled. Budget for this emotionally and schedule-wise.

[Maintaining all pre-move friendships at the same level] removed: some will become long-distance close friends, most will drift to the wider network tier, and a few will fade entirely. This is the cost of geographic change, not a personal failure. Focus your limited long-distance energy on the 3-5 relationships that matter most.

## Existing Obligations

Social time competes with work, family, training, rest, and personal interests. The solution is not to sacrifice everything else for social life -- it's to integrate.

**Integration strategies:**
- Walking calls during commute or exercise time (social + movement)
- Training with a friend (social + fitness)
- Family meals that include friends occasionally (family + wider network)
- Working alongside a friend in silence at a coffee shop (presence without energy cost)
- Group activities that align with hobbies (social + personal interest)

**Protecting social time.** If you schedule training, you should also schedule social commitments. Put the weekly hangout on the calendar. Treat it with the same seriousness as a workout. If you consistently skip social commitments in favor of work or training, the problem is prioritization, not time.

[Filling every free hour with social commitments] removed: rest and solitude are not wasted time. The goal is consistent, sustainable connection -- not a packed social calendar. If you're an introvert or in a demanding life phase, protecting unscheduled time is as important as scheduling social time.

## Individual History

Some people find social connection naturally easy. Others find it terrifying, confusing, or exhausting in ways that go beyond introversion. This section is about recognizing when your history is affecting your present.

**Attachment patterns.** If you consistently push people away when they get close, or cling to relationships out of fear of abandonment, or avoid intimacy entirely, these patterns often trace back to early relationships and can be addressed with professional help. Recognizing the pattern is the first step; a therapist who works with attachment is the most effective next step.

**Social anxiety.** If the thought of attending a group event or making a phone call produces physical anxiety, the Base Program may feel impossible. Start smaller: one text per week, one brief in-person interaction. Consider whether the anxiety is situational (normal nervousness in new settings) or pervasive (interfering with daily functioning). The latter warrants professional support -- therapy, particularly CBT or exposure-based approaches, has strong evidence for social anxiety.

**Neurodivergence.** ADHD, autism, and other neurodevelopmental differences affect social interaction in specific ways -- difficulty reading social cues, challenges with executive function around planning and follow-through, sensory overwhelm in group settings. The Base Program's structure (specific actions, specific frequencies) may actually help by externalizing what neurotypical people do intuitively. Adapt the interaction formats to your strengths: if phone calls are hard, use voice memos. If group settings are overwhelming, prioritize one-on-one. The goal is connection, not conformity to neurotypical social norms.

**Chronic illness and disability.** Conditions that limit energy, mobility, or predictability (chronic pain, autoimmune disorders, mental health episodes) make the Base Program's cadence unrealistic at times. Adapt the format, not the intent: if you can't leave the house, a video call counts. If your energy is unpredictable, have a standing open invitation with a close friend rather than fixed plans that produce guilt when cancelled. The people worth keeping will accommodate fluctuation when you communicate honestly about what you need.

**Cultural context.** Social norms around friendship vary enormously across cultures -- expectations about directness, physical affection, frequency of contact, the role of family versus friends, and how conflict is handled. If you grew up in a different cultural context than the one you currently live in, mismatches are inevitable and not your fault. Explicitly discussing expectations ("In my family, we call every day -- I know that's not everyone's norm") prevents misunderstandings.

**When to get help.** If you are consistently unable to form or maintain relationships despite genuine effort, or if social situations cause significant distress, or if you recognize patterns you can't change on your own, talk to a therapist. This is not a weakness or a failure of willpower. Social connection is a fundamental need, and sometimes the wiring needs professional attention.
