# Exercise by Muscle

### 1. The Push Complex (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)
*Goal: Anterior Pushing Muscles.*

*Rationale: The Chest is the largest muscle group here. Triceps get hit hard during chest/shoulder pressing, so they go last.*

# Weightlifting Exercises

## Push Exercises

### Chest

#### Flat Barbell Bench Press

The primary compound chest movement. Lie on a flat bench, unrack the barbell with a grip slightly wider than shoulder width, lower to mid-chest, and press back up. Targets the entire pectoralis major with emphasis on the sternal (mid) fibers. Keep shoulder blades retracted and feet planted.

#### Incline Dumbbell Press

Set the bench to 30-45 degrees. Press dumbbells from shoulder level to lockout. The incline shifts emphasis to the upper (clavicular) chest fibers. Dumbbells allow a greater range of motion and more natural wrist rotation than a barbell.

#### Cable Crossovers

Stand between two cable stations with the pulleys set high. Bring the handles together in a hugging arc in front of your chest. Provides constant tension through the full range of motion and a deep stretch at the bottom. Targets the inner and lower chest fibers.

#### Dumbbell Flyes

Lie on a flat bench holding dumbbells above your chest with a slight bend in the elbows. Lower the weights in a wide arc until you feel a stretch across the chest, then squeeze back together. Emphasizes the chest stretch under load.

#### Dips (Chest Emphasis)

Lean your torso forward on parallel bars, flare the elbows slightly, and lower until the upper arms are parallel to the ground. The forward lean shifts the work from triceps to the lower chest. Add weight with a belt once bodyweight becomes easy.

### Shoulder

#### Military Press

Press a barbell from the front of the shoulders to overhead while standing. The strict standing position engages the full shoulder girdle and requires core bracing. Primarily targets the anterior and lateral deltoids.

#### Seated Dumbbell Overhead Press

Press dumbbells overhead from shoulder height while seated. The seated position isolates the shoulders by removing lower body momentum. Allows each arm to work independently, fixing imbalances.

#### Cable Lateral Raises

Stand beside a low cable and raise the handle out to the side until the arm is parallel to the floor. The cable provides constant tension throughout the movement, unlike dumbbells which lose tension at the bottom. Targets the lateral deltoid for shoulder width.

#### Face Pulls

Pull a rope attachment on a high cable toward your face, separating the ends as you pull. Externally rotates the shoulders and targets the rear deltoids, rhomboids, and rotator cuff. Essential for shoulder health and posture.

#### Cable External Rotations

Stand sideways to a cable set at elbow height. Keep the elbow pinned to your side and rotate the forearm outward. Isolates the infraspinatus and teres minor of the rotator cuff. Use light weight for high reps.

#### Arnold Press

Start with dumbbells in front of your shoulders, palms facing you. As you press overhead, rotate your palms to face forward at the top. The rotation hits the anterior, lateral, and posterior deltoids through one continuous movement.

#### Reverse Flyes

Bend forward at the hips or lie face-down on an incline bench. Raise dumbbells out to the sides with a slight elbow bend. Targets the posterior deltoids and upper back. Counterbalances all the pressing work.

### Triceps

#### Close-Grip Bench Press

Bench press with hands shoulder-width apart or slightly narrower. The narrow grip shifts the primary load from the chest to the triceps, particularly the lateral and medial heads. Also a heavy compound that allows significant overload.

#### Skullcrushers

Lie on a bench holding an EZ-bar or dumbbells above your forehead. Lower the weight by bending at the elbows until it reaches near your forehead, then extend back up. Targets the long head of the triceps through a deep stretch.

#### Tricep Rope Pushdowns

Push a rope attachment down on a high cable, spreading the ends apart at the bottom for a peak contraction. Targets the lateral head of the triceps. Keep the elbows pinned to your sides throughout.

#### Overhead Tricep Extensions

Hold a dumbbell or cable overhead and lower it behind your head by bending at the elbows. The overhead position places the long head of the triceps in a deep stretch, which is the most effective position for growing it.

## Pull Exercises

### Back

#### Weighted Pull-Ups

Hang from a bar with a pronated (overhand) grip and pull your chin above the bar with added weight from a belt or vest. The primary vertical pulling movement. Targets the lats, teres major, and biceps. Grip width determines lat emphasis.

#### Wide-Grip Lat Pulldowns

Pull a wide bar down to your upper chest on a cable machine. A more accessible alternative to pull-ups that allows finer load adjustment. The wide grip emphasizes the outer lats for back width.

#### Straight-Arm Pulldowns

Stand facing a high cable and push the bar down in an arc with straight arms until it reaches your thighs. Isolates the lats by removing bicep involvement. Provides a strong peak contraction and stretch.

#### Barbell Rows

Hinge at the hips, keep your back flat, and row a barbell to your lower chest or upper abdomen. The primary horizontal pulling compound. Targets the entire mid-back, lats, rhomboids, and rear deltoids. Go heavy.

#### Chest-Supported T-Bar Rows

Lie face-down on an incline pad and row a T-bar or dumbbells. The chest support eliminates lower back fatigue and cheating, isolating the mid-back muscles. Allows you to focus purely on squeezing the shoulder blades together.

#### Seated Cable Rows

Sit at a cable row station with feet braced, pull the handle to your lower chest, and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Constant cable tension and a stable position allow you to focus on the mind-muscle connection with the mid-back.

#### Rack Pulls

Pull a barbell from pins set at or just below knee height to lockout. A partial range deadlift that allows very heavy loading on the upper back, traps, and erector spinae. Also builds grip strength.

#### Good Mornings

Place a barbell on your upper back and hinge forward at the hips while keeping a slight knee bend and a flat back. Targets the erector spinae, hamstrings, and glutes. A posterior chain builder that directly improves squat and deadlift strength.

#### Weighted Hyperextensions

Lock your feet into a hyperextension bench, hold a plate or dumbbell against your chest, and hinge at the hips to lower and raise your torso. Builds the erector spinae, glutes, and hamstrings with less spinal compression than barbell movements.

### Traps

#### Farmer's Walks

Hold heavy dumbbells or farmer's handles at your sides and walk for distance or time. Builds the upper traps, grip, forearms, and core stability simultaneously. One of the most functional strength exercises.

#### Barbell Shrugs

Hold a barbell at arm's length and shrug your shoulders straight up toward your ears. Targets the upper trapezius for trap mass. Use straps to allow heavier loads without grip being the limiter.

#### Kelso Shrugs

Lie face-down on an incline bench and shrug dumbbells by squeezing your shoulder blades together and upward. Targets the mid and lower trapezius, which are important for posture and scapular stability.

### Biceps

#### Weighted Chin-Ups

Hang from a bar with a supinated (underhand) grip and pull your chin over the bar with added weight. The supinated grip increases biceps recruitment compared to pull-ups while still being a heavy compound back movement.

#### Barbell Curls

Stand holding a barbell with an underhand grip and curl it to shoulder height. The foundational biceps exercise. Allows the heaviest loading of any curl variation. Keep elbows pinned to the sides to prevent swinging.

#### Incline Dumbbell Curls

Sit on a bench set to 45-60 degrees and curl dumbbells from a fully extended arm position. The incline places the biceps in a stretched position at the bottom, emphasizing the long head for the bicep peak.

#### Hammer Curls

Curl dumbbells with a neutral (palms facing each other) grip. Targets the brachialis and brachioradialis in addition to the biceps. The brachialis sits underneath the biceps and pushes it up for a thicker arm appearance.

### Forearms

#### Reverse Barbell Curls

Curl a barbell with an overhand (pronated) grip. Shifts the load from the biceps to the brachioradialis and wrist extensors. Builds the outer forearm mass visible when the arms are at rest.

#### Barbell Wrist Curls

Sit with forearms resting on your thighs, palms up, and curl a barbell by flexing the wrists. Isolates the wrist flexors on the inner forearm. Use controlled reps with a full range of motion.

#### Plate Pinches

Pinch two or more weight plates together smooth-side-out and hold for time. Builds thumb and finger strength through isometric grip work. Targets the muscles of the hand and inner forearm that other grip exercises miss.

## Leg Exercises

### Quads

#### Barbell Front Squat

Hold a barbell across the front of your shoulders in a clean grip or crossed-arm position and squat to full depth. The upright torso position shifts emphasis to the quadriceps and reduces lower back stress compared to back squats. Also demands significant core and upper back engagement.

#### Bulgarian Split Squats

Stand in a split stance with your rear foot elevated on a bench. Lower your hips until the front thigh is parallel to the ground. A unilateral movement that builds single-leg strength, fixes imbalances, and requires significant balance and hip stability.

#### Leg Extensions

Sit in a leg extension machine and extend your knees to straighten the legs. Isolates the quadriceps, particularly the rectus femoris and vastus medialis (teardrop). Useful for adding volume without spinal loading.

### Hamstrings

#### Deadlift

Stand over a barbell, hinge at the hips with a flat back, grip the bar, and stand up by driving through the floor. The king of posterior chain exercises. Loads the hamstrings, glutes, erectors, traps, and grip simultaneously. The heaviest lift most people will perform.

#### Romanian Deadlift

Hold a barbell at hip height and hinge forward at the hips while keeping the legs nearly straight, lowering the bar along the thighs until you feel a deep hamstring stretch. Emphasizes the eccentric stretch of the hamstrings and builds the hip hinge pattern.

#### Seated Leg Curls

Sit in a leg curl machine and curl your heels toward your glutes. Isolates the hamstrings, particularly at the knee-flexion function. The seated position places the hamstrings in a slightly stretched position for greater muscle activation.

### Glutes

#### Barbell Hip Thrusts

Sit with your upper back against a bench, place a loaded barbell across your hips, and drive your hips upward to full extension. The most direct glute exercise. Allows heavy loading with peak tension at the top where the glutes are fully contracted.

#### Walking Lunges

Step forward into a lunge, lower until both knees are at 90 degrees, then drive through the front heel to step into the next rep. Combines glute and quad work with dynamic balance. The walking component adds a functional element.

#### Cable Hip Abductions

Stand sideways to a low cable with an ankle strap and lift your leg out to the side against the resistance. Isolates the gluteus medius and minimus. Important for hip stability and preventing knee valgus during squats and running.

### Calves

#### Donkey Calf Raises

Bend at the hips on a donkey calf raise machine or with a partner on your back and perform calf raises. The hip-flexed position pre-stretches the gastrocnemius for greater range of motion and activation. Allows heavy loading.

#### Standing Calf Raises

Stand on the edge of a step or in a calf raise machine and raise up onto your toes, then lower through a full stretch. Targets the gastrocnemius, the larger two-headed calf muscle. The straight-leg position maximally engages this muscle.

#### Seated Calf Raises

Sit in a seated calf raise machine with the pad on your lower thighs and perform calf raises. The bent-knee position takes the gastrocnemius out of the movement, isolating the soleus. The soleus contributes significantly to overall calf size.

### Adductors

#### Sumo Squats

Squat with a wide stance and toes pointed outward, holding a dumbbell or kettlebell between your legs. The wide stance increases adductor and inner thigh recruitment compared to a standard squat. Also hits the glutes heavily.

#### Copenhagen Plank

Lie on your side with your top leg on a bench and your bottom leg hanging free. Squeeze the top leg into the bench to hold your body in a side plank position. A bodyweight adductor strengthener that also builds core stability. Used widely in injury prevention programs.

#### Adductor Machine

Sit in the adductor machine with pads against your inner thighs and squeeze your legs together. Directly isolates the adductor muscle group. Simple to load progressively and useful for building baseline adductor strength.

## Core Exercises

### Abs

#### Hanging Leg Raises

Hang from a pull-up bar and raise your legs until they are parallel to the floor or higher. Targets the rectus abdominis with emphasis on the lower portion. The hanging position also builds grip endurance and decompresses the spine.

#### Weighted Cable Crunches

Kneel in front of a high cable with a rope attachment behind your head and crunch downward, bringing your elbows toward your knees. Allows progressive overload of the rectus abdominis, which is difficult to achieve with bodyweight alone.

#### Dead Bugs

Lie on your back with arms extended toward the ceiling and knees bent at 90 degrees. Slowly extend the opposite arm and leg while keeping your lower back pressed into the floor. Teaches anti-extension core stability and proper bracing patterns.

### Obliques

#### Suitcase Carries

Hold a heavy dumbbell or kettlebell in one hand at your side and walk for distance while keeping your torso completely upright. Forces the obliques and quadratus lumborum to resist lateral flexion. A functional anti-lateral-flexion exercise.

#### Cable Woodchoppers

Stand sideways to a cable set high or low and rotate your torso to pull the handle diagonally across your body. Trains rotational power through the obliques and transverse abdominis. Adjust the cable height to target different angles.

#### Side Planks

Lie on your side, prop yourself up on your forearm, and hold your body in a straight line. An isometric exercise that builds endurance in the obliques and quadratus lumborum. Add hip dips or top-arm reaches for additional challenge.

### Deep Core

#### Ab Wheel Rollouts

Kneel on the floor holding an ab wheel and roll forward, extending your body toward the ground while maintaining a flat back, then pull back to the starting position. One of the most demanding anti-extension exercises. Targets the entire anterior core under high tension.

#### Stomach Vacuums

Stand, sit, or kneel and exhale all air from your lungs, then pull your navel in toward your spine as hard as possible and hold. Targets the transversus abdominis, the deepest abdominal muscle. Builds the ability to brace and creates a tighter waistline.

#### Planks

Hold a push-up position on your forearms with your body in a straight line from head to heels. The foundational anti-extension exercise that builds endurance in the rectus abdominis, obliques, and deep core. Add weight on your back or extend the duration to progress.

# Muscle Anatomy

## Torso

### Chest

#### Pectoralis Major

The large, fan-shaped muscle of the upper chest. Has three portions: the upper (clavicular) fibers originate from the collarbone and are hit by incline pressing, the mid (sternal) fibers originate from the breastbone and are the primary movers in flat pressing, and the lower (costal) fibers originate from the upper abs and are emphasized by decline pressing and dips. All fibers insert on the upper arm and function to adduct, flex, and internally rotate the shoulder.

#### Pectoralis Minor

A small, thin muscle that lies underneath the pectoralis major. Originates from ribs 3-5 and inserts on the scapula's coracoid process. Protracts and depresses the scapula. Often tight from hunching over a desk, which can contribute to rounded shoulders. Stretched by opening the chest and pulling the shoulders back.

#### Serratus Anterior

A saw-toothed muscle that wraps around the side of the ribcage from ribs 1-8 to the inner border of the scapula. Protracts the scapula and holds it flat against the ribcage. Activated heavily during push-ups and punching motions. Weakness causes scapular winging. Often called the "boxer's muscle."

### Back

#### Latissimus Dorsi

The widest muscle in the body, spanning from the lower spine, iliac crest, and lower ribs to the upper arm. Responsible for shoulder extension, adduction, and internal rotation. The primary mover in pull-ups, pulldowns, and rows. Gives the back its V-taper width. Often called "the lats."

#### Trapezius

A large diamond-shaped muscle spanning from the base of the skull to the mid-back and out to the shoulder blades. Divided into three functional regions: the upper traps elevate the scapula (shrugging), the mid traps retract the scapula (squeezing shoulder blades together), and the lower traps depress and upwardly rotate the scapula. Hit by shrugs, rows, and face pulls respectively.

#### Rhomboids

Two muscles (major and minor) lying deep to the trapezius between the spine and the scapula. Retract and downwardly rotate the scapula. Important for posture and scapular stability. Activated during rowing movements when you squeeze the shoulder blades together at the end of the rep.

#### Erector Spinae

A group of three muscles (iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis) running vertically along the spine from the sacrum to the skull. Extend and laterally flex the spine. They keep you upright and resist spinal flexion. Loaded heavily during deadlifts, squats, rows, and good mornings. Often called "the spinal erectors."

#### Teres Major

A thick muscle on the lower border of the scapula that assists the latissimus dorsi in shoulder extension, adduction, and internal rotation. Sometimes called "the lat's little helper." Activated during pull-ups, rows, and pulldowns.

#### Teres Minor

A small muscle on the back of the scapula, part of the rotator cuff. Externally rotates the shoulder and stabilizes the humeral head in the socket. Strengthened by external rotation exercises and face pulls.

#### Infraspinatus

A large rotator cuff muscle covering most of the back of the scapula. The primary external rotator of the shoulder. Works with the teres minor to decelerate internal rotation and stabilize the shoulder joint. Strengthened by external rotation exercises.

### Shoulder

#### Anterior Deltoid

The front portion of the deltoid, originating from the outer third of the clavicle. Flexes and internally rotates the shoulder. The primary mover in front raises and heavily involved in all pressing movements (bench press, overhead press). Often the most developed deltoid head due to pressing frequency.

#### Lateral Deltoid

The middle portion of the deltoid, originating from the acromion process of the scapula. Abducts the shoulder (raises the arm to the side). Responsible for shoulder width. Targeted by lateral raises and upright rows. Requires dedicated isolation work since compound pressing alone is often insufficient.

#### Posterior Deltoid

The rear portion of the deltoid, originating from the spine of the scapula. Extends and externally rotates the shoulder. Often underdeveloped relative to the anterior deltoid, contributing to rounded shoulders. Targeted by reverse flyes, face pulls, and wide-grip rows.

#### Supraspinatus

The smallest rotator cuff muscle, sitting in the supraspinous fossa above the spine of the scapula. Initiates shoulder abduction (the first 15 degrees of raising the arm). Runs through a narrow bony passage, making it the most commonly injured rotator cuff muscle. Strengthened by light lateral raises and external rotations.

#### Infraspinatus

A large rotator cuff muscle covering most of the back of the scapula. The primary external rotator of the shoulder. Stabilizes the humeral head in the socket during all shoulder movements. Strengthened by cable external rotations and face pulls.

#### Teres Minor

A small rotator cuff muscle on the lateral border of the scapula. Assists the infraspinatus in external rotation and shoulder stabilization. Works synergistically with the infraspinatus during all external rotation exercises.

#### Subscapularis

The largest and strongest rotator cuff muscle, located on the front surface of the scapula (between the scapula and the ribcage). The primary internal rotator of the shoulder. Stabilizes the humeral head during all arm movements. Difficult to isolate; strengthened through internal rotation exercises against a cable or band.

## Arms

### Upper Arm

#### Biceps Brachii

The two-headed muscle on the front of the upper arm. The long head (outer) originates from the top of the shoulder socket and creates the bicep peak. The short head (inner) originates from the coracoid process and adds width. Both heads flex the elbow and supinate the forearm. The long head is best stretched by incline curls; the short head is hit hardest by preacher curls.

#### Brachialis

A thick muscle lying deep to the biceps on the front of the upper arm. A pure elbow flexor (does not supinate). Pushes the biceps up from underneath, making the arm look thicker. Best targeted by hammer curls and reverse curls where the biceps are at a mechanical disadvantage.

#### Triceps Brachii

The three-headed muscle on the back of the upper arm, making up roughly two-thirds of upper arm mass. The long head originates from the scapula and is the only head that crosses the shoulder joint, making it best targeted by overhead extensions. The lateral head (outer) and medial head (inner, deep) originate from the humerus and are hit by pushdowns and close-grip pressing. All three heads extend the elbow.

#### Coracobrachialis

A small, deep muscle running from the coracoid process of the scapula to the mid-humerus. Assists in shoulder flexion and adduction. Not typically trained in isolation; activated during pressing and pulling movements. Can become tight and contribute to shoulder impingement.

### Forearm

#### Brachioradialis

The largest forearm muscle, running from the outer lower humerus to the radius near the wrist. Flexes the elbow, particularly when the forearm is in a neutral (thumbs-up) position. The primary mover during hammer curls. Gives the forearm its prominent outer shape.

#### Wrist Flexors

A group of muscles on the inner forearm: the flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, and palmaris longus. Originate from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and flex and deviate the wrist. Trained by wrist curls and grip work. The palmaris longus is absent in about 14% of people.

#### Wrist Extensors

A group of muscles on the outer forearm: the extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, and extensor carpi ulnaris. Originate from the lateral epicondyle and extend and deviate the wrist. Trained by reverse wrist curls and reverse curls. Commonly affected in tennis elbow.

#### Pronator Teres

Runs diagonally across the inner forearm from the medial epicondyle to the mid-radius. Pronates the forearm (turns the palm face-down) and assists in elbow flexion. Trained indirectly by most pulling and curling movements.

#### Supinator

A deep forearm muscle wrapping around the upper radius. Supinates the forearm (turns the palm face-up). Works with the biceps during supination. Trained indirectly through supinated curl movements.

#### Finger Flexors

The flexor digitorum superficialis (closer to the surface) and flexor digitorum profundus (deeper) flex the fingers. The superficialis flexes the middle joints, the profundus flexes the fingertips. Together they are responsible for grip strength. Trained by all gripping exercises: deadlifts, rows, farmer's walks, and dedicated grip work.

#### Finger Extensors

The extensor digitorum on the back of the forearm extends all four fingers. Important for hand balance and preventing overuse injuries from gripping. Trained by rubber band extensions or reverse grip exercises. Often neglected relative to the flexors.

## Core

### Abs

#### Rectus Abdominis

The "six-pack" muscle running vertically from the pubic bone to the ribcage, divided by tendinous intersections. Flexes the spine (crunching motion) and resists extension. The upper portion is hit more by crunches; the lower portion is hit more by leg raises. One continuous muscle, not truly separate upper and lower sections, but different exercises shift the bias.

### Obliques

#### External Obliques

The outermost oblique muscles, running diagonally downward from the lower ribs to the pelvis and linea alba. Rotate the torso to the opposite side (left external oblique rotates torso to the right), laterally flex the trunk, and assist in trunk flexion. Trained by woodchoppers, side bends, and rotational movements.

#### Internal Obliques

Lie deep to the external obliques, with fibers running perpendicular (diagonally upward). Rotate the torso to the same side (left internal oblique rotates torso to the left) and laterally flex the trunk. Work together with the opposite external oblique during rotation. Also assist in forced expiration and intra-abdominal pressure.

### Transverse

#### Transversus Abdominis

The deepest abdominal muscle, wrapping horizontally around the torso like a corset. Does not produce movement but compresses the abdomen to increase intra-abdominal pressure, which stabilizes the spine. Activated by bracing, stomach vacuums, and heavy compound lifts. Foundational for core stability and safe lifting.

#### Diaphragm

The dome-shaped muscle separating the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. The primary muscle of breathing. Descends during inhalation to expand the lungs and rises during exhalation. Plays a critical role in bracing for heavy lifts: a deep breath combined with core bracing creates a rigid trunk. Trained through diaphragmatic breathing practice.

#### Pelvic Floor Muscles

A hammock of muscles spanning the base of the pelvis, including the levator ani and coccygeus. Support the pelvic organs, assist in continence, and contribute to intra-abdominal pressure during bracing. Co-contract with the transversus abdominis during heavy lifting. Strengthened through Kegel exercises and proper bracing technique.

#### Multifidus

Small, deep muscles spanning 2-4 vertebrae along the entire length of the spine. Stabilize individual vertebral segments during all movement. Work constantly during standing, walking, and lifting. Weakness or atrophy is strongly associated with chronic lower back pain. Trained by bird dogs, dead bugs, and any exercise requiring spinal stability under load.

## Legs

### Glutes

#### Gluteus Maximus

The largest and most powerful muscle in the body. Originates from the ilium, sacrum, and coccyx and inserts on the femur and IT band. Extends and externally rotates the hip. The primary mover in hip thrusts, squats, deadlifts, and sprinting. Most active at full hip extension and under heavy load.

#### Gluteus Medius

A fan-shaped muscle on the outer surface of the pelvis, partially covered by the gluteus maximus. Abducts the hip and stabilizes the pelvis during single-leg stance (walking, running, lunging). Weakness causes hip drop (Trendelenburg sign) and contributes to knee valgus. Trained by lateral band walks, cable hip abductions, and single-leg exercises.

#### Gluteus Minimus

The smallest and deepest of the three glute muscles, lying beneath the medius. Assists in hip abduction and internal rotation. Works with the medius to stabilize the pelvis during gait. Trained by the same exercises as the medius.

### Upper Leg

#### Quadriceps

Four muscles on the front of the thigh that extend the knee: the rectus femoris (crosses the hip and knee, also flexes the hip), vastus lateralis (outer quad), vastus medialis (inner quad, the "teardrop" near the knee), and vastus intermedius (deep, between the lateralis and medialis). Together they are the primary knee extensors. The rectus femoris is more active in movements where the hip is extended (leg extensions, sissy squats); the vasti are more active in squats.

#### Hamstrings

Three muscles on the back of the thigh: the biceps femoris (two heads, on the outer hamstring), semitendinosus (inner, more superficial), and semimembranosus (inner, deeper). All cross both the hip and knee, extending the hip and flexing the knee. The biceps femoris is more active in hip extension with external rotation; the semis are more active with internal rotation. Trained by deadlifts (hip extension emphasis) and leg curls (knee flexion emphasis).

#### Adductors

Five muscles on the inner thigh: the adductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus adduct the hip (pull the leg inward). The gracilis crosses both the hip and knee. The pectineus also flexes the hip. The adductor magnus is the largest and has both an adductor portion and a hamstring-like portion that extends the hip. Trained by sumo squats, Copenhagen planks, and adductor machines.

#### Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL)

A small muscle on the outer front of the hip that connects to the IT band. Flexes, abducts, and internally rotates the hip. Often overactive in people who sit a lot, compensating for weak glutes. Can contribute to IT band syndrome when tight. Managed by strengthening the glute medius and stretching the hip flexors.

#### Sartorius

The longest muscle in the body, running diagonally across the front of the thigh from the outer hip to the inner knee. Flexes, abducts, and externally rotates the hip, and flexes the knee. Involved in crossing the legs. Not typically trained in isolation; activated during compound leg movements.

### Lower Leg

#### Gastrocnemius

The two-headed muscle forming the visible bulge of the calf. The medial head (inner) is usually larger; the lateral head (outer) is smaller. Crosses both the knee and ankle, flexing the knee and plantarflexing the ankle (pointing the toes). Most active with a straight knee, which is why standing calf raises target it preferentially.

#### Soleus

A broad, flat muscle lying deep to the gastrocnemius. Crosses only the ankle joint and plantarflexes the foot. Most active with a bent knee, which is why seated calf raises isolate it. Makes up the majority of calf volume and is critical for endurance activities like running and walking. Composed primarily of slow-twitch fibers.

#### Tibialis Anterior

The muscle on the front of the shin, running from the upper tibia to the top of the foot. Dorsiflexes the ankle (lifts the toes) and inverts the foot. Active during walking to prevent foot slap. Weakness or fatigue contributes to shin splints. Trained by toe raises or resisted dorsiflexion.

#### Tibialis Posterior

A deep muscle on the back of the lower leg, lying behind the tibia. Plantarflexes and inverts the foot and supports the arch. The primary dynamic stabilizer of the medial arch. Dysfunction leads to flat feet and is a common source of medial ankle pain. Strengthened through single-leg calf raises and arch-strengthening exercises.

#### Peroneals

Two muscles on the outer lower leg: the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. Evert the foot (tilt the sole outward) and assist in plantarflexion. Stabilize the ankle against inversion sprains. The longus also supports the transverse arch of the foot. Trained by eversion exercises against a band and single-leg balance work.


# Factors for Exercise Selection

## Stimulus Quality

### Stretch Under Load

Exercises that place a muscle under tension while it is in a lengthened position produce greater hypertrophy. Incline dumbbell curls stretch the biceps long head at the bottom, Romanian deadlifts stretch the hamstrings, and cable flyes stretch the chest. Prefer exercises that challenge the muscle most in the stretched position over those that are hardest at the shortened position.

### Full Range of Motion

Moving through the complete range a joint allows recruits more muscle fibers and builds strength across the entire length-tension curve. Partial reps have their place for overload, but the default should be full ROM. Deep squats outperform half squats for quad and glute growth.

### Resistance Profile

The resistance curve of an exercise should match the strength curve of the muscle. Cables provide constant tension, free weights are hardest at specific joint angles, and machines can be cam-shaped to match the muscle's output. Choose the tool that keeps the target muscle challenged through the full rep.

### Mind-Muscle Connection

If you cannot feel the target muscle working during an exercise, it is likely not the best choice for you. Isolation exercises and cables tend to produce better mind-muscle connection than heavy compounds. This matters more for hypertrophy than for strength.

## Practical Factors

### Loadability

The exercise should allow progressive overload in small increments over time. Barbell exercises are the most loadable (fractional plates exist). Dumbbell exercises jump in 5 lb increments, which can be too large for small muscles. Cable stacks vary by machine.

### Stability Demands

Unstable exercises (standing single-arm cable work, Bulgarian split squats) limit the load you can use because stabilizers fatigue first. This is beneficial for athleticism and joint health but reduces the stimulus to the target muscle. Use stable exercises (machines, chest-supported rows) when the goal is maximum muscle stimulus, and less stable ones for functional carryover.

### Joint Stress

Some exercises place disproportionate stress on joints relative to the muscle stimulus they provide. Behind-the-neck presses stress the shoulder capsule, deep skull crushers stress the elbows, and leg presses with excessive depth stress the lumbar spine. Prefer exercises that load the muscle hard while keeping joints in comfortable positions.

### Fatigue Cost

Compound barbell movements (squats, deadlifts, barbell rows) produce high systemic fatigue relative to the muscle stimulus for any single muscle group. This is fine when they are the primary lift of a session but inefficient when added as accessory volume. Use machines and cables for accessory work to accumulate volume without excessive fatigue.

## Individual Factors

### Anthropometry

Limb lengths and torso proportions affect which exercises feel natural and which do not. Long-femur lifters may squat better with a wider stance or prefer front squats. Long-armed lifters often find deadlifts easier but bench press harder. Choose exercises that let you load the target muscle through a pain-free range with your body proportions.

### Injury History

Previous injuries change which exercises are appropriate. A history of shoulder impingement may mean replacing flat barbell bench with a neutral-grip dumbbell press. Chronic low back issues may favor hip thrusts over deadlifts for glute work. There is almost always a pain-free alternative that trains the same muscle.

### Equipment Availability

The best exercise is one you can actually do consistently. A home gym with a barbell and rack requires different exercise selection than a fully equipped commercial gym. Cables and machines expand exercise options significantly, but a barbell, dumbbells, and a pull-up bar cover the fundamentals.
