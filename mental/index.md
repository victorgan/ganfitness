The **Base Program** prescribes a daily mental health maintenance routine. The **Comprehensive Mental Health Guide** explains the reasoning and expands the toolkit. The remaining sections are reference material.

This is a maintenance and optimization guide for people who are generally functional. It is not therapy. It is not a substitute for professional help. If you are in crisis, skip everything here and call 988 (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline) or go to your nearest emergency room.

# Base Program

A daily mental health maintenance routine. Do exactly this for at least 8 weeks before modifying. The morning and evening blocks take 5–10 minutes each. The tools here are simple on purpose — consistency matters more than sophistication. Mental health, like physical fitness, responds to regular low-intensity maintenance far better than sporadic intense effort. If you miss a day, do it the next day. Partial adherence beats no adherence.

**Non-negotiable rule:** If anything in this program increases your distress rather than reducing it, stop that specific practice. This is information, not failure. See [When to Get Professional Help](#when-to-get-professional-help).

## Morning Routine

5–10 minutes. Do this before checking your phone.

**1. Structured journal entry (3–5 min).** Write by hand or type. Use this exact format:

- **Current state:** One sentence describing how you feel right now. Name the emotion specifically — not "bad" but "anxious about the presentation" or "flat and unmotivated." See [Emotional Labeling](#emotional-regulation) for why specificity matters.
- **Top priority:** The single most important thing you will do today. Not a to-do list. One thing. See [time management](/time/index.md) if identifying the top priority is consistently difficult.
- **Anticipated difficulty:** One thing today that will be hard, and one sentence about how you will handle it. This is pre-commitment, not worry.

**2. Intention setting (30 sec).** Choose one word or phrase that describes how you want to show up today. Examples: patient, focused, generous, direct. This is not a mood prediction. It is a behavioral aim.

[Positive affirmations] removed: evidence shows generic affirmations ("I am worthy") can backfire for people with low self-esteem by highlighting the gap between the statement and their beliefs. Intention setting works because it targets behavior, not identity.

## During the Day

No fixed schedule. Build these into existing transitions — between meetings, after lunch, when switching tasks.

**1. Stress check-ins (3x daily, 30 sec each).** Tie these to existing habits (morning coffee, lunch, mid-afternoon) or set alarms until the habit sticks. At each check-in:

- Rate your stress 1–10.
- If 7+, do one [physiological sigh](#breathwork): double inhale through the nose, long exhale through the mouth. Takes 15 seconds. Among the fastest evidence-based methods to downregulate the sympathetic nervous system.
- If 5–6, note it and continue. Awareness alone reduces the accumulation of unnoticed stress.
- If 1–4, carry on.

**2. Cognitive reframing moments.** When you notice yourself stuck in a negative thought loop (replaying a conversation, dreading a future event, criticizing yourself), do this:

- Name the [cognitive pattern](#cognitive-patterns-reference). You do not need to get it exactly right. "That sounds like [catastrophizing](#catastrophizing)" is enough.
- Ask: "What would I say to a friend in this situation?" This is not about being positive. It is about applying the same standard of evidence you would apply to someone else's problem.

**3. Breaks.** Every 90 minutes of focused work, take 5–10 minutes away from screens. Walk, look at something far away, or do nothing. This is not productivity advice. Sustained attention without breaks degrades emotional regulation capacity.

## Evening Routine

5–10 minutes. Do this in the last hour before bed.

**1. Gratitude practice (2 min).** Write three specific things from today. The key word is specific. Not "my family" but "the conversation with my brother about his new job." Specificity forces actual recall rather than generating a generic list, which is what makes the practice effective. Rotate categories: one person, one experience, one small thing you usually overlook.

[Gratitude journaling for 10+ items] removed: research shows diminishing returns past three items, and longer lists become rote rather than reflective.

**2. Worry dump (2–3 min).** Write down everything you are worried about. Do not organize, solve, or evaluate. Just transfer it from your head to paper. The goal is to externalize open loops so your brain stops cycling on them. If a worry is actionable, write the single next step beside it. If it is not actionable, write "not in my control" and move on.

**3. Screen and stimulation cutoff.** No news, social media, or high-stimulation content in the final 30 minutes before sleep. This is a boundary, not a suggestion. The emotional activation from these sources directly impairs sleep onset, and poor [sleep](/sleep/index.md) is the single fastest way to degrade mental health.

## Weekly Check-In

15–20 minutes. Pick a consistent day and time. Sunday evening works well.

**1. Life satisfaction check (5 min).** Rate each area 1–10. Do not overthink the numbers — first instinct is fine.

| Area | Score (1–10) | One-sentence note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Physical health | | |
| Mental/emotional state | | |
| Relationships | | |
| Work/purpose | | |
| Fun/play | | |
| Environment (home, finances) | | |

**2. Pattern review (5 min).** Look at the week's journal entries. What emotions came up most often? Any recurring worries? Any [cognitive patterns](#cognitive-patterns-reference) showing up repeatedly? You are looking for trends, not problems.

**3. Adjustment (5 min).** Pick one area scoring below 5 and identify one concrete action for the coming week. Not a plan to overhaul your life. One action. If no areas are below 5, pick the area with the most downward trend and address it early.

## Red Flags

Stop optimizing and see a professional if any of the following are true for two or more weeks:

- You cannot enjoy things you normally enjoy (anhedonia)
- You are sleeping significantly more or less than usual despite no external cause
- Your appetite has changed substantially without explanation
- You are withdrawing from people you care about
- You are using alcohol, drugs, or other numbing behaviors more than usual
- You cannot concentrate at work or on basic tasks
- You feel hopeless about the future — not pessimistic, but genuinely unable to imagine things improving
- You have thoughts of self-harm or suicide — **do not wait two weeks; act immediately.** Call 988 or go to an emergency room.

These are not signs of weakness. They are symptoms. See [When to Get Professional Help](#when-to-get-professional-help) for next steps.

# Comprehensive Mental Health Guide

## Emotional Regulation

The ability to experience emotions without being controlled by them. This is not about suppressing or "managing" feelings — it is about expanding the gap between stimulus and response so you can act rather than react.

**Emotional labeling.** Naming emotions with specificity reduces amygdala activation. "I feel anxious" is better than "I feel bad." "I feel anxious about being judged during the presentation" is better still. Research by Lieberman et al. shows that the act of labeling alone reduces the intensity of the emotional response. Practice in your [morning journal](#morning-routine).

**Cognitive reframing.** Identifying and restructuring distorted thoughts. This is the core mechanism of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the most evidence-backed self-help technique. See the full [Cognitive Patterns Reference](#cognitive-patterns-reference) for specific distortions and reframing methods. Reframing is not about being positive — it is about being accurate.

**Distress tolerance.** When emotions are too intense for reframing (grief, panic, rage), the goal shifts from changing the thought to surviving the feeling without making it worse. Effective short-term tools:

- Cold exposure: hands in ice water or cold water on your face for 30 seconds. Triggers the dive reflex, which slows heart rate.
- Intense physical sensation: hold an ice cube, do 20 pushups, squeeze your hands together hard. Redirects attention from emotional pain to physical input.
- Paced breathing: [physiological sighs](#breathwork) or [box breathing](#breathwork) until the acute wave passes.

These are circuit breakers, not solutions. If you need them daily, that is a signal to seek professional support.

**Window of tolerance.** Everyone has a range of arousal in which they can function — too activated (anxiety, rage) or too deactivated (numbness, dissociation) and cognitive function degrades. The goal of regulation is to widen this window over time. [Meditation](#meditation), [exercise](/lift/index.md), adequate [sleep](/sleep/index.md), and consistent daily routine all widen the window. Trauma narrows it. If your window is very narrow — you go from fine to overwhelmed quickly, or you feel numb most of the time — work with a therapist, not a self-help guide.

[Emotion suppression] removed: longitudinal research consistently shows that habitual suppression increases physiological stress responses and is associated with worse mental and physical health outcomes. Regulation is not suppression.

## Stress Management

Stress is not inherently harmful. Acute, time-limited stress with recovery is how the body adapts and grows — the same principle as progressive overload in [lifting](/lift/index.md). Chronic stress without adequate recovery is where damage accumulates. The distinction matters because the tools are different.

**Acute stress (minutes to hours).** A deadline, a difficult conversation, an unexpected problem. Tools:

- [Physiological sigh](#breathwork): fastest way to downregulate. One rep takes 15 seconds.
- Reappraisal: "I am stressed about this" becomes "My body is preparing to perform." Reframing stress arousal as facilitative (rather than debilitative) improves performance in controlled studies.
- Time-limited worry: set a 10-minute timer, worry deliberately, then stop and act. This is not suppression — it is containment.
- Physical discharge: a walk, pushups, shaking your hands. Stress hormones prepare the body for movement. Move.

**Chronic stress (weeks to months).** A bad job, a struggling relationship, financial pressure, caregiving burden. Acute tools do not fix chronic problems. Tools:

- Identify the source honestly. Most chronic stress comes from one or two areas. The [weekly check-in](#weekly-check-in) helps you see this.
- Determine what is in your control. Change what you can. For what you cannot change immediately, build recovery into your week: protected time, [nature exposure](#nature-exposure), [social connection](#social-connection), [exercise](/lift/index.md).
- Reduce unnecessary stressors. Audit commitments, information intake, and relationships that drain without replenishing. See [time management](/time/index.md) for a structured approach to commitment auditing.
- Set boundaries. Chronic stress often involves saying yes to things that cost more than they return. This is a skill, not a personality trait.

If chronic stress persists despite these steps, the appropriate response is to change the situation or get professional support — not to develop a better coping routine for an unsustainable circumstance.

[Stress balls and fidget devices] removed: no evidence of meaningful stress reduction beyond brief distraction. Use [breathwork](#breathwork) instead.

## Rumination and Worry

Rumination is replaying past events. Worry is rehearsing future threats. Both feel productive — your brain presents them as problem-solving. They are not. They are repetitive, unconstructive, and self-reinforcing loops.

**Breaking rumination loops:**

1. **Notice the loop.** Rumination often starts unconsciously. The first skill is catching it: "I've been replaying that conversation for 20 minutes."
2. **Label it.** "This is rumination, not problem-solving." The distinction: problem-solving has a goal and an endpoint. Rumination has neither.
3. **Change the channel.** Engage a different sensory mode or cognitive task. Physical activity works best — a walk, a workout. Absorbing activities (cooking, music, conversation) also work. Passive consumption (TV, scrolling) usually does not break the loop.
4. **Scheduled worry time.** Paradoxically, giving worry a scheduled slot (15 minutes, same time daily) reduces total worry. When worry arises outside that window, note it and postpone: "I'll think about that at 6 PM." This works because the brain releases the loop when it trusts the concern will be addressed.

**Breaking worry loops:**

1. **Categorize.** Is this worry actionable? If yes, write the next step and do it or schedule it. If no, practice letting it go — which is a skill that improves with repetition, not a personality trait.
2. **Challenge the probability.** Most worries describe low-probability worst cases. Ask: "What is the most likely outcome?" and "What would I do if the worst case actually happened?" Having a plan, even a rough one, reduces the anxious energy around uncertainty.
3. **Defusion.** Instead of "I'm going to fail," try "I'm having the thought that I'm going to fail." This is an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) technique that creates distance between you and the thought. It sounds trivial. It works.

[Thought stopping ("just don't think about it")] removed: research shows it reliably increases the frequency of the suppressed thought. Defusion and scheduled worry are more effective.

## Self-Talk and Inner Critic

Everyone has an internal monologue. In many people, that monologue is disproportionately harsh — applying standards to the self that they would never apply to others. This is not "having high standards." It is a pattern that predicts depression, anxiety, and burnout.

**Identifying the critic.** The inner critic uses specific language patterns that map to [cognitive distortions](#cognitive-patterns-reference):

- Absolute language: "I always fail at this." ([Overgeneralization](#overgeneralization))
- Mind reading: "Everyone noticed I messed up." ([Mind reading](#mind-reading))
- Demands: "I should have known better." ([Should statements](#should-statements))
- Catastrophic conclusions: "This mistake will ruin everything." ([Catastrophizing](#catastrophizing))

**Correcting the critic.** Not by arguing, but by applying evidence:

1. Write the critical thought verbatim.
2. Identify which [cognitive pattern](#cognitive-patterns-reference) it uses.
3. Write what you would say to a friend who told you this about themselves.
4. Write a revised thought that is honest but accurate. Not positive — accurate.

Example: "I'm terrible at my job" becomes "I made an error on one project. My last performance review was positive. I need to fix this specific thing."

**Self-compassion vs. self-esteem.** Self-esteem is a judgment ("I am good"). Self-compassion is a stance ("I am struggling and that is human"). Research by Kristin Neff shows self-compassion is more psychologically stable and less contingent on external validation than self-esteem. It does not reduce motivation — self-compassionate people are more likely to try again after failure.

[Daily positive self-talk scripts] removed: pre-written scripts bypass the actual cognitive work. Use the four-step correction process above instead, which builds the skill of evidence-based self-assessment.

## Purpose and Meaning

A sense of meaning is consistently associated with better mental health outcomes, greater resilience, and longer lifespan. But meaning is not something you discover in a single moment — it is something you construct through repeated action aligned with your values.

**Values identification.** Values are not goals. Goals are endpoints ("get promoted"). Values are directions ("do meaningful work"). A practical exercise:

1. List 5–10 things you have done in the past year that felt genuinely satisfying — not things that looked good externally, but moments that felt right.
2. For each, ask: what value was I living in that moment? (Connection, mastery, creativity, service, autonomy, honesty, adventure, etc.)
3. Look for the 3–4 values that appear most often. These are your operating values, regardless of what you think they should be.

**Goal alignment.** Check your current commitments against your values. If your top value is connection but you spend 60 hours a week at a job that isolates you, the resulting distress is not a personal failing — it is a misalignment. The appropriate response is to adjust the commitment, not to develop better coping skills for a life that does not fit.

**Behavioral activation.** When motivation is low, action precedes feeling — not the other way around. Do not wait until you feel like doing something meaningful. Schedule one values-aligned action per day, however small, and do it regardless of mood. This is genuinely hard when you are depressed — the low motivation is not laziness, it is a symptom. Start absurdly small if needed. Motivation follows action more reliably than action follows motivation. This is one of the most replicated findings in depression research.

[Finding your passion] removed: the "passion" framework implies a single correct answer that you must discover. Research by O'Keefe et al. shows this fixed mindset about interest actually reduces persistence. Meaning comes from investment in activities, not from finding the one right activity.

## Resilience Building

Resilience is not a personality trait. It is a capacity that can be built through deliberate practice — specifically, through manageable exposure to difficulty followed by adequate recovery.

**Deliberate challenge.** Regularly do things that are uncomfortable but not overwhelming:

- Physical challenges: [exercise](/lift/index.md), cold exposure. These build the neurological association between discomfort and being okay.
- Social challenges: difficult conversations, asking for what you need, setting boundaries. See [social skills](/social/index.md) for structured approaches.
- Cognitive challenges: learning new skills, accepting feedback, admitting mistakes publicly.

The key word is manageable. The goal is to stretch your capacity, not break it. Pushing through when you are already depleted does not build resilience — it builds burnout.

**Recovery practices.** Resilience requires recovery with the same necessity that muscle growth requires rest days:

- [Sleep](/sleep/index.md): 7–9 hours. Non-negotiable. Sleep deprivation impairs emotional regulation more than any other single factor.
- Downtime: unscheduled time with no purpose. Not "recovery activities" — actual idleness. The default mode network (responsible for self-reflection and creative insight) activates during unfocused rest.
- [Social connection](/social/index.md): time with people who do not require performance.
- [Nature exposure](#nature-exposure): even 20 minutes reduces cortisol measurably.

**Post-adversity growth.** After a difficult period, deliberately reflect on what you learned and what capacities you developed. This is not toxic positivity ("everything happens for a reason"). It is accurate accounting: you went through something hard, and you are different now. What is different? What do you know that you did not know before? This process, studied as post-traumatic growth, is more likely when people have adequate [social support](/social/index.md) and time to process.

# Cognitive Patterns Reference

Common thinking traps that distort perception. These are not character flaws — they are cognitive shortcuts that evolved for rapid threat detection but misfire in modern contexts. Everyone uses them. The skill is catching them in real time.

Each entry: what the pattern looks like, why the brain does it, and how to reframe.

## Catastrophizing

**What it looks like:** Jumping to the worst possible outcome and treating it as inevitable. "I made a mistake in the email — I'll get fired — I'll lose my apartment — my life is over."

**Why the brain does it:** Threat detection optimized for survival. In ancestral environments, assuming the worst and preparing for it was adaptive. In modern contexts, it generates disproportionate anxiety for low-probability events.

**Reframe:** Walk the chain of consequences to its actual likelihood. "What is the most likely outcome of this mistake?" Usually: minor correction, brief embarrassment, no lasting impact. If the worst case is genuinely possible, plan for it — a plan reduces anxiety more effectively than reassurance.

## Black-and-White Thinking

**What it looks like:** Seeing situations in only two categories — success or failure, good or bad, always or never. "If I can't do it perfectly, there's no point." "Either they like me or they don't."

**Why the brain does it:** Categorization is efficient. Nuance requires cognitive effort. Under stress, the brain defaults to simpler processing.

**Reframe:** Insert the middle. "What would 70% look like?" Most of life operates in gradients. A workout you half-completed is better than no workout. A conversation that was 60% good is not a failed conversation.

## Mind Reading

**What it looks like:** Assuming you know what others are thinking, usually that they are judging you negatively. "She paused before answering — she thinks my idea is stupid." "They didn't text back — they're annoyed with me."

**Why the brain does it:** Social threat detection. Anticipating others' judgments was important for group survival. The brain fills in ambiguity with the most threatening interpretation as a precaution.

**Reframe:** Separate observation from interpretation. Observation: "She paused." Interpretation: "She thinks my idea is stupid." Is there another explanation for a pause? Dozens. You cannot know what someone is thinking unless they tell you. If it matters, ask.

## Should Statements

**What it looks like:** Rigid rules about how you or others must behave. "I should be further along by now." "He should have known that would bother me." "I shouldn't feel this way."

**Why the brain does it:** Internalized rules from upbringing, culture, and social comparison provide structure and predictability. But when applied rigidly, they generate guilt (directed inward) or resentment (directed outward).

**Reframe:** Replace "should" with "I'd prefer" or "it would help if." "I'd prefer to be further along" acknowledges the desire without the self-punishment. "It would help if he knew that bothered me — I'll tell him" transforms resentment into action.

## Emotional Reasoning

**What it looks like:** Taking your feelings as evidence of reality. "I feel like a fraud, so I must be one." "I feel anxious about the flight, so it must be dangerous." "I don't feel like going, so it must be a bad idea."

**Why the brain does it:** Emotions are fast, powerful signals. They feel like truth because they evolved to feel that way — a survival mechanism does not benefit from self-doubt.

**Reframe:** Feelings are data, not facts. "I feel like a fraud" is information about your emotional state. It is not evidence about your competence. Ask: "What external evidence supports or contradicts this feeling?" If the evidence contradicts the feeling, trust the evidence.

## Personalization

**What it looks like:** Assuming you are the cause of external events. "The team failed because of me." "She's in a bad mood — I must have done something." "If I'd been a better partner, they wouldn't have left."

**Why the brain does it:** Agency detection. The brain prefers to find a cause (especially one it can control) over accepting randomness or shared responsibility.

**Reframe:** List all contributing factors, not just your role. Most outcomes have multiple causes. Your contribution is one input, not the sole determinant. "The team failed" might involve bad timing, unclear scope, resource constraints, and yes, your contribution — but probably not only your contribution.

## Negative Filtering

**What it looks like:** Selectively attending to negative information and discounting positive information. You get nine positive comments and one criticism, and you fixate on the criticism. You had a good day but focus on the one thing that went wrong.

**Why the brain does it:** Negativity bias. Negative information is weighted more heavily because, evolutionarily, threats were more important to detect than opportunities. Missing a threat could be fatal; missing an opportunity was merely suboptimal.

**Reframe:** Deliberately widen the aperture. Ask: "What am I filtering out?" Write down three things that went well alongside the one thing that went poorly. The [evening gratitude practice](#evening-routine) exists specifically to counterbalance this bias.

## Overgeneralization

**What it looks like:** Drawing broad conclusions from a single event. "I got rejected — I'll always be rejected." "That relationship failed — I'm bad at relationships." "I couldn't stick to the plan — I have no discipline."

**Why the brain does it:** Pattern recognition from limited data. The brain forms rules quickly, even from one data point, because waiting for a larger sample was dangerous in ancestral environments.

**Reframe:** Check the sample size. One event is one data point. Ask: "How many times has this actually happened versus how many times has it not?" "I got rejected once" is very different from "I always get rejected." Look for the counterexamples your brain is ignoring.

# Practices Reference

Evidence-based practices for mental health maintenance. Each entry covers what it is good for, minimum effective dose, evidence quality, and common failure modes. Not every practice works for every person — see [Individual Variation](#individual-variation).

## Meditation

**What it is good for:** Attention regulation, emotional awareness, reduced reactivity, decreased rumination. Moderate evidence for anxiety and depression reduction. A training tool for the attentional skills that support other practices — not a cure on its own.

**Important caution:** Meditation can surface difficult emotions and, in people with trauma history or latent psychiatric conditions, can trigger flashbacks, dissociation, or panic. If you have a trauma history, start with very short sessions (2–5 minutes), use focused-attention techniques only, and stop if you experience distress. Consider working with a therapist before establishing a meditation practice. See [History](#history).

**Which types work for what:**

- **Focused attention** (follow the breath): builds concentration, reduces mind-wandering. Start here.
- **Open monitoring** (observe thoughts without engagement): builds meta-awareness — the ability to watch your own mental processes. Useful for catching [cognitive patterns](#cognitive-patterns-reference) in real time. Not recommended as a starting point for people with anxiety or trauma, as increased awareness of anxious thoughts can be destabilizing without foundational attentional control.
- **Loving-kindness** (direct goodwill toward self and others): moderate evidence for reducing self-criticism and increasing positive social emotions. Can feel forced — if it does, use another type.

**Minimum effective dose:** 10 minutes daily. Research shows benefits at this level for attention and emotional regulation. More is not always better — some people report increased anxiety with long sessions.

**Evidence quality:** Strong for attention and moderate for mood. Weaker than often claimed for anxiety and depression compared to active controls (like [exercise](/lift/index.md) or CBT). Meditation is a good supplement, not a first-line treatment for clinical conditions.

**Common failure modes:** Treating it as relaxation (it is attention training — sometimes it is uncomfortable). Judging yourself for having thoughts (the practice is noticing you drifted and returning, not preventing drift). Expecting transformation in weeks (it is a slow-building skill). Doing it inconsistently — ten minutes daily beats one hour weekly.

[Meditation retreats for beginners] removed: intensive multi-day practice without experienced guidance can destabilize people with unprocessed trauma or latent psychiatric conditions. Build a consistent daily practice first and work with an experienced teacher before attending retreats.

## Journaling

**What it is good for:** Emotional processing, self-awareness, pattern recognition, externalizing worry. Strong evidence for reducing intrusive thoughts and improving mood when done with structure.

**Specific protocols:**

- **Structured daily entry:** The format in the [Base Program](#morning-routine). Takes 3–5 minutes and provides a daily emotional snapshot.
- **Expressive writing (Pennebaker protocol):** Write about a difficult experience for 15–20 minutes, 3–4 consecutive days. Focus on your deepest thoughts and feelings. Moderate evidence for improved immune function and reduced distress, particularly for experiences you have not disclosed to anyone. **Caution:** For traumatic experiences, this protocol can be re-traumatizing without professional support. If writing about an event increases distress that persists beyond the session, stop and consider doing this work with a [therapist](#therapy).
- **Worry journaling:** The [evening worry dump](#evening-routine). Externalizes anxious thoughts and breaks rumination loops.
- **Cognitive restructuring log:** When you catch a [cognitive distortion](#cognitive-patterns-reference), write: the situation, the automatic thought, the distortion type, and a reframed thought. This is the written form of CBT.

**Minimum effective dose:** 3–5 minutes daily for maintenance. 15–20 minutes for targeted processing of specific events.

**Evidence quality:** Strong for expressive writing about stressful events. Moderate for daily journaling. The evidence supports structured writing with emotional content — not gratitude lists alone and not stream-of-consciousness without emotional engagement.

**Common failure modes:** Writing about events without engaging emotions (report mode). Journaling as rumination (re-describing the same problem repeatedly without new insight). Over-journaling to the point where writing replaces action — if you are spending more than 20 minutes daily, redirect that time toward doing something.

## Breathwork

**What it is good for:** Acute stress reduction, anxiety management, sleep onset, emotional regulation. Strong evidence for specific techniques; weak evidence for the broad category.

**Specific techniques:**

- **Physiological sigh:** Double inhale through the nose (a full inhale, then one more short sniff to maximally inflate the lungs), then a long, slow exhale through the mouth. One cycle takes about 15 seconds. Fastest known method to reduce physiological arousal. A Stanford study (Balban et al., 2023, Cell Reports Medicine) found it outperformed other breathing techniques for reducing physiological arousal. Use for acute stress during the day.
- **Box breathing (4-4-4-4):** Inhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, exhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds. Repeat for 2–5 minutes. Good for sustained calming before a stressful event. Used by military and first responders.
- **4-7-8 breathing:** Inhale 4 seconds, hold 7 seconds, exhale 8 seconds. The extended exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Good for sleep onset.
- **Diaphragmatic breathing:** Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Breathe so only the belly hand moves. Practice for 5 minutes. This retrains shallow chest breathing, which is both a symptom and a maintainer of chronic anxiety.

**Minimum effective dose:** One physiological sigh for acute stress. 2–5 minutes of paced breathing for sustained calming. Daily diaphragmatic breathing practice for chronic anxiety.

**Evidence quality:** Strong for physiological sigh (single study but well-designed) and box breathing (replicated across multiple contexts). Moderate for 4-7-8. The general principle — slow breathing with extended exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system — is well established.

**Common failure modes:** Trying to breathe "correctly" and getting more anxious. If a technique feels suffocating, try a different one or reduce the hold times. Hyperventilation from too-rapid deep breathing — slow down.

## Therapy

**What it is good for:** Clinical depression, clinical anxiety, trauma, relationship problems, grief, life transitions, persistent patterns you cannot change alone. Therapy is not just for crisis — it is the mental health equivalent of having a coach.

**Types and what each is best suited for:**

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** The most researched therapy. Restructures distorted thinking and changes maladaptive behaviors. Strong evidence for depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia. Structured, time-limited (often 12–20 sessions), skills-based. Good first choice if you are unsure what type to try.
- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Builds psychological flexibility — the ability to be present with difficult thoughts and feelings while taking values-aligned action. Good for chronic pain, anxiety, and situations where control strategies have stopped working.
- **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):** Processes traumatic memories by pairing recall with bilateral stimulation. Strong evidence for PTSD. Often faster than talk-based trauma processing. Requires a trained EMDR clinician.
- **Psychodynamic therapy:** Explores how past experiences (especially early relationships) shape current patterns. Good for long-standing relational difficulties and recurring life patterns. Less structured, often longer-term.
- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Originally developed for borderline personality disorder. Teaches distress tolerance, emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness. Useful for anyone with intense emotional reactivity, not just BPD.

**When to start:** See [When to Get Professional Help](#when-to-get-professional-help) for crisis criteria. But also consider therapy proactively: during major life transitions, when you notice recurring patterns, when self-help tools stop being sufficient, or when you want to understand yourself better.

**How to find a therapist:** Psychology Today's therapist directory allows filtering by insurance, specialty, and approach. Ask for a consultation (most offer a free 15-minute call). Key questions: What is your approach? Do you have experience with [your issue]? How do you measure progress? Give it 3–4 sessions before deciding it is not working — the first session is intake, not treatment.

**Evidence quality:** Strong across all listed modalities for their target conditions. CBT has the largest evidence base. The therapeutic alliance (how well you connect with your therapist) is a stronger predictor of outcome than the specific modality — a good fit matters more than the "right" technique.

**Common failure modes:** Choosing based on convenience alone rather than fit. Not doing homework between sessions (therapy works between sessions, not just during them). Quitting after one bad session. Staying with a therapist who is not helping because you feel guilty about leaving.

## Exercise

**What it is good for:** Depression (strong evidence — comparable to antidepressants for mild-to-moderate cases in multiple meta-analyses), anxiety (strong evidence), stress management, [sleep](/sleep/index.md), cognitive function, self-efficacy. For moderate-to-severe depression, exercise is best used alongside medication and/or therapy, not as a replacement.

**How it works:** Increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which supports neuroplasticity. Reduces inflammatory markers associated with depression. Provides a sense of agency and mastery. Regulates the stress response system. [Nutrition](/nutrition/index.md) affects these same pathways — the two are synergistic.

**Minimum effective dose:** 150 minutes per week of moderate activity (brisk walking counts) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity. For mental health specifically, even 30 minutes three times per week produces significant benefits. See the [lifting program](/lift/index.md) for a complete strength and conditioning plan.

**Evidence quality:** Strong. One of the strongest non-pharmacological interventions for depression and anxiety.

**Common failure modes:** All-or-nothing thinking — "If I can't do a full workout, there's no point." A 10-minute walk is meaningfully better for mood than nothing. Using exercise as avoidance — running from emotions rather than processing them (exercise supplements emotional processing, it does not replace it). Overtraining, which increases cortisol and worsens mood.

## Nature Exposure

**What it is good for:** Stress reduction, attention restoration, rumination reduction. Moderate evidence for mood improvement and reduced anxiety.

**Minimum effective dose:** 20 minutes in a natural setting, three times per week. Walking in a park counts — you do not need wilderness. Research by MaryCarol Hunter et al. shows cortisol drops significantly with 20–30 minutes of nature exposure.

**Evidence quality:** Moderate. Most studies are observational or have small samples. The proposed mechanisms (attention restoration theory, stress reduction theory) are plausible and consistent across studies, but the field is younger than CBT or exercise research.

**Common failure modes:** Scrolling your phone while in nature (the attentional benefits require actually engaging with the environment). Treating it as another optimization task rather than genuine disengagement.

## Social Connection

**What it is good for:** Loneliness reduction, emotional regulation (co-regulation), sense of belonging, resilience. Social isolation is a major risk factor for depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and mortality. See [social skills](/social/index.md) for structured approaches to building and maintaining connection.

**Minimum effective dose:** One meaningful social interaction per day. "Meaningful" means reciprocal engagement, not parallel presence. A five-minute genuine conversation counts. A two-hour gathering where you are on your phone does not.

**Evidence quality:** Strong for the relationship between social connection and mental health. The causal direction is bidirectional — isolation worsens mental health, and poor mental health increases isolation. This means connection is both prevention and intervention.

**Common failure modes:** Confusing social media interaction with social connection (the research consistently shows they are not equivalent). Waiting until you feel like being social (when depressed, you will not feel like it — go anyway). Maintaining draining relationships out of obligation while neglecting nourishing ones.

# Assessment and Tracking

Monitor your mental health without becoming obsessive about it. The goal is pattern recognition — catching downward trends early enough to intervene.

**Daily:** The [morning journal entry](#morning-routine) gives you an emotional data point each day. Do not analyze daily fluctuations. Bad days are normal.

**Weekly:** The [weekly check-in](#weekly-check-in) gives you a structured snapshot. Track your six area scores over time. A number that is consistently below 5 or trending downward over 3–4 weeks warrants attention.

**Monthly:** Review your weekly check-in scores. Look for patterns: seasonal changes, correlation with [sleep](/sleep/index.md) or [exercise](/lift/index.md), impact of specific relationships or work situations. This is where actionable insight lives — not in daily mood swings.

## What to Track

| Metric | Method | Frequency | Action threshold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mood | Morning journal emotion label | Daily | Persistent low mood >2 weeks |
| Stress | 1–10 check-in | 3x daily | Averaging 7+ for >1 week |
| Sleep | Hours + quality (1–5) | Daily | <6 hrs or quality <3 for >1 week |
| Life satisfaction | 6-area score | Weekly | Any area <5 for >3 weeks |
| Social contact | Number of meaningful interactions | Weekly | <3 per week for >2 weeks |

## When to Be Concerned vs. When to Ride It Out

Temporary dips are normal. A bad day, a bad week, even a bad couple of weeks after a significant life event — these are not pathology. They are the expected human response to difficulty. Concern is warranted when: the duration exceeds what the situation warrants, you cannot identify a cause, or your ability to function is impaired. See [Red Flags](#red-flags) and [When to Get Professional Help](#when-to-get-professional-help).

[Daily mood tracking apps with granular scoring] removed: for some people, particularly those prone to anxiety, intensive self-monitoring increases symptom focus and worsens outcomes. The tracking framework above is intentionally light.

# Factors for Mental Health Decisions

There is no universally best mental health practice. What works depends on who you are, what you are dealing with, and what resources you have. The factors below help you choose and adjust.

| Category | Factor | Key Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Baseline Temperament](#baseline-temperament) | Anxiety tendency | Do I tend toward worry and hypervigilance? |
| [Baseline Temperament](#baseline-temperament) | Depression tendency | Do I tend toward low energy and withdrawal? |
| [Baseline Temperament](#baseline-temperament) | Emotional intensity | Do I experience emotions more intensely than average? |
| [Current Stress Load](#current-stress-load) | Acute stressors | Am I dealing with a specific time-limited challenge? |
| [Current Stress Load](#current-stress-load) | Chronic stressors | Am I under sustained pressure without clear endpoints? |
| [Current Stress Load](#current-stress-load) | Recovery capacity | Do I have enough recovery time relative to my stress load? |
| [History](#history) | Trauma | Have past experiences narrowed my window of tolerance? |
| [History](#history) | Previous episodes | Have I experienced clinical depression or anxiety before? |
| [History](#history) | Treatment response | What has worked or not worked for me in the past? |
| [Support System](#support-system) | Professional support | Do I have access to a therapist or psychiatrist? |
| [Support System](#support-system) | Social support | Do I have people I can be honest with? |
| [Support System](#support-system) | Financial resources | Can I access the tools I need? |
| [Life Transitions](#life-transitions) | Type of transition | Is this a gain, a loss, or a role change? |
| [Life Transitions](#life-transitions) | Adjustment timeline | How long has it been since the transition began? |
| [Individual Variation](#individual-variation) | Practice preference | Which practices do I actually do consistently? |
| [Individual Variation](#individual-variation) | Experimentation history | What have I tried, and what were the results? |

## Baseline Temperament

People vary in their default emotional tendencies, and effective strategies differ accordingly.

**Anxiety-prone:** Your nervous system runs hot. You are more likely to experience worry, physical tension, hypervigilance, and difficulty relaxing. Prioritize: [breathwork](#breathwork) (daily, not just when stressed), [exercise](/lift/index.md) (high-intensity helps discharge excess arousal), scheduled worry time, [meditation](#meditation) (start with focused attention — open monitoring can initially increase awareness of anxious thoughts). Deprioritize: excessive self-monitoring, stimulant intake (caffeine is an anxiety amplifier), open-ended rumination disguised as problem-solving.

**Depression-prone:** Your system runs cool. You are more likely to experience low motivation, withdrawal, heaviness, and difficulty finding pleasure. Prioritize: behavioral activation (action before motivation), [social connection](/social/index.md) (even when you do not feel like it), [exercise](/lift/index.md) (the evidence for exercise in depression is particularly strong), structured daily routine, adequate [nutrition](/nutrition/index.md) (nutritional deficiencies can compound depressive symptoms). Deprioritize: waiting for motivation, isolation, sleep excess (hypersomnia maintains depression — set an alarm and get up).

**High emotional intensity:** You feel everything strongly — both positive and negative emotions. This is not a disorder; it is a trait. But it requires management. Prioritize: [distress tolerance](#emotional-regulation) skills, [journaling](#journaling) for processing, [DBT](#therapy) skills if intensity causes interpersonal problems. Deprioritize: suppression (it does not work with high intensity and causes rebound), substances that numb (they create dependency quickly in high-intensity people).

## Current Stress Load

Your available coping capacity is finite. What you can handle depends on what else is on your plate.

**Low stress load:** Good time to build capacity — take on new challenges, practice discomfort, expand your skills. Invest in [resilience building](#resilience-building).

**Moderate stress load:** Maintain your [Base Program](#base-program). This is normal operating range. Focus on consistency rather than adding new practices.

**High stress load:** Simplify. Cut the [Base Program](#base-program) to the minimum: one [physiological sigh](#breathwork) when stress spikes, [evening worry dump](#evening-routine), and protect [sleep](/sleep/index.md) above all else. This is not the time to start a meditation practice or overhaul your life. Survive the acute period, then rebuild.

**Overloaded:** You are past the point where self-management is sufficient. Reduce commitments, ask for help, and consider [professional support](#therapy). Trying to optimize your way through overload is like trying to lift through a serious injury — it makes things worse.

## History

Past experience shapes what is appropriate now.

**Trauma history:** Some practices can be destabilizing without professional guidance. [Meditation](#meditation) can surface traumatic material — start with very short sessions (2–5 minutes of focused-attention only) and stop if you experience flashbacks, dissociation, or panic. [Expressive writing](#journaling) about traumatic events can be effective but also re-traumatizing without support — consider doing it in conjunction with [therapy](#therapy) rather than alone. Body-based practices ([breathwork](#breathwork), [exercise](/lift/index.md)) are generally safer starting points. If you have a trauma history, working with a trauma-informed therapist is strongly recommended before intensive self-help work.

**Previous episodes of depression or anxiety:** If you have had clinical episodes before, you are at elevated risk for recurrence. This is neurobiology, not a moral failing. Maintain the [Base Program](#base-program) as prevention, not just during symptomatic periods. Know your early warning signs (the specific changes in [sleep](/sleep/index.md), appetite, social behavior, and thinking that preceded previous episodes) and have a plan for when they appear.

**Treatment response:** If a medication or therapy worked before, that is useful information. If something did not work, that is also useful — but distinguish between "it did not work" and "I did not give it enough time" or "the implementation was poor." Antidepressants typically need 4–6 weeks at therapeutic dose. Therapy needs at least 6–8 sessions to evaluate.

## Support System

What you can self-manage depends on what external support you have.

**Strong support system (close relationships, professional access, financial stability):** You can handle more self-directed work and can afford to experiment. Use the full [Base Program](#base-program) and [Comprehensive Guide](#comprehensive-mental-health-guide).

**Limited support system:** Prioritize building one. This is not a nice-to-have — it is a necessity. Even one trusted person makes a measurable difference. Community groups, peer support, group therapy, and structured social activities (classes, clubs, volunteering) are all pathways to connection that do not require an existing network. See [social connection](/social/index.md) for more.

**No professional access:** Many of the tools in this guide work without a therapist. If cost is the barrier, look into community mental health centers (sliding scale), university training clinics (supervised therapy at reduced cost), crisis hotlines (988), and self-guided CBT workbooks (Feeling Good by David Burns is the best-validated). These are not as good as working with a professional, but they are meaningfully better than nothing.

## Life Transitions

Transitions are inherently destabilizing, and distress during them is expected — not pathological.

**Grief and loss:** There is no timeline for grief. The "stages of grief" model is widely misunderstood — grief is not linear and does not follow a predictable sequence. Expect waves. The intensity of waves typically decreases over months, not weeks. If grief is preventing you from functioning after 6+ months, complicated grief therapy is effective.

**Job and career changes:** Identity disruption is normal when work changes, even for positive changes (promotions, desired moves). Expect a transition period of 3–6 months before the new situation feels normal. Maintain the [Base Program](#base-program) and resist the urge to evaluate whether the change was right during the first month.

**Relationship changes:** Whether it is a breakup, a new relationship, a marriage, or becoming a parent, relationship transitions reorganize your daily life and emotional landscape. Let the transition be difficult. Trying to be fine immediately is a form of avoidance.

## Individual Variation

What works for you will not be identical to what works for anyone else. This is not a limitation of the tools — it is a feature of human neurological and psychological diversity.

**Experimentation protocol:** Try a new practice for at least 4 weeks before evaluating. Track the specific outcome you are trying to change (mood, [sleep](/sleep/index.md), stress, rumination). If after 4 weeks there is no noticeable change, try something different. Do not add multiple practices simultaneously — you will not know what is working.

**Permission to discard:** If a well-evidenced practice consistently does not work for you or makes things worse, stop doing it. This is data, not failure. Meditation is not for everyone. Journaling is not for everyone. The best practice is the one you will actually do consistently.

# When to Get Professional Help

Therapy is not a last resort. It is a tool — like a coach for your mind. That said, there are specific signals that indicate professional support is not just helpful but necessary.

**Seek help immediately if:**

- You are having thoughts of suicide or self-harm. Call 988 (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline) or go to your nearest emergency room.
- You are experiencing hallucinations or delusions
- You are unable to care for yourself (not eating, not sleeping for days, unable to leave bed)
- You are using substances to cope and cannot stop

**Seek help within the next week if:**

- Symptoms from the [Red Flags](#red-flags) checklist have persisted for 2+ weeks
- You are unable to function at work or maintain relationships due to your mental state
- You have had a panic attack — a discrete episode with physical symptoms (chest tightness, shortness of breath, feeling of impending doom) lasting 10–30 minutes, distinct from general anxiety
- You are experiencing intrusive thoughts that distress you
- A traumatic event has occurred and you are having flashbacks, nightmares, or avoiding reminders

**Consider help proactively if:**

- You notice recurring patterns you cannot change alone (same relationship dynamics, same self-sabotage, same avoidance)
- You are going through a major life transition and want support
- The tools in this guide are not producing results after 8+ weeks of consistent use
- You want to understand yourself better — therapy does not require a crisis

**What to expect:** The first session is usually an assessment — the therapist gathers history and you evaluate fit. Give it 3–4 sessions before deciding if it is working. If after 6–8 sessions you do not notice any shift in understanding or behavior, discuss it with your therapist or consider a different one. A good therapist will not be offended.

**Cost barriers:** If cost prevents access, in order of preference: employer EAP programs (usually 6–8 free sessions), community mental health centers, university training clinics, group therapy (roughly one-third the cost of individual), self-guided CBT workbooks with peer support. Something is better than nothing.
