# Base Program

A fixed daily sleep routine. Do exactly this. Every time, temperature, and behavior is specified — don't improvise until you've run this for at least 4 weeks. Sleep quality matters as much as [training quality](/lift/index.md), and unlike training, you cannot compensate for bad sleep with more effort. Most people who think they sleep fine are adapted to chronic deprivation. Run this protocol honestly for a month and see what changes.

**Target:** 8 hours in bed, 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. Adjust by your [chronotype](#chronotype) if needed, but keep the 8-hour window and fixed times.

**Non-negotiable:** Same bedtime and wake time every day, including weekends. This is the single highest-impact change you can make. Everything else is secondary.

**What good sleep looks like:** You fall asleep within 10–15 minutes. You do not fully wake during the night. You wake 0–5 minutes before your alarm feeling ready to get up. You do not need caffeine to function in the morning — you want it, but you do not need it. Your energy is stable from mid-morning through early evening. If this does not describe your current experience, this program will help.

**Quick reference — all the numbers:**

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sleep window | 10:00 PM – 6:00 AM (8 hours) |
| Wind-down start | 8:30 PM (90 min before bed) |
| Last screen | 8:30 PM |
| Last substantial meal | 8:00 PM |
| Last caffeine | 2:00 PM |
| Last intense exercise | 8:00 PM (2 hours before bed) |
| Bedroom temperature | 65°F (18°C) |
| Morning light exposure | Within 2 min of waking |
| First caffeine | 90 min after waking (7:30 AM) |
| Max nap duration | 20 min (before 2:00 PM) |

## Evening Routine

Start at 8:30 PM — 90 minutes before lights-out. This is not optional downtime. It is a structured protocol.

| Time | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 8:30 PM | Last screen use. Put your phone in another room, on a charger, on Do Not Disturb. Close the laptop. TV off. |
| 8:30 PM | Dim all house lights to the minimum comfortable level. Use warm-toned bulbs (2700K or lower) or candlelight. Overhead lights off. |
| 8:45 PM | Hot shower or bath (10 minutes). The heat vasodilates your skin; when you get out, your core temperature drops rapidly, which accelerates sleep onset. |
| 9:00 PM | Light snack if hungry: small portion of casein-rich food (cottage cheese, Greek yogurt) or complex carbs (oatmeal, banana). Nothing heavy. See [meal timing guidance](/nutrition/index.md). |
| 9:00 PM | Non-stimulating activity: read a physical book, stretch, journal, talk with someone. No problem-solving, no work, no news. |
| 9:30 PM | Brush teeth, wash face, change into sleep clothes. Keep bathroom lights dim — use a nightlight or leave the main light off. |
| 9:40 PM | Bedroom only. Lights off except a dim reading lamp if you want 15 more minutes of a book. |
| 9:45 PM | If your mind is racing: write a quick brain dump — tomorrow's tasks, worries, unresolved thoughts — on paper by the bed. Close the notebook. Done. See [rumination management](/mental/index.md). |
| 10:00 PM | Lights off. Eyes closed. |

If you are not asleep within 20 minutes, get up, go to a dim room, and read or stretch until you feel drowsy. Return to bed. Do not lie in bed frustrated — this trains your brain to associate bed with wakefulness. This technique is called **stimulus control** and is the cornerstone of CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia). The goal is to maintain the bed–sleep association: bed means sleep, not anxiety. If it takes three trips out of bed the first few nights, that is normal. The association strengthens within a week.

## Bedroom Setup

Configure once. Check monthly.

| Factor | Setting |
| :--- | :--- |
| Temperature | 65°F (18°C). Use a thermostat or fan. Err cold — you can add a blanket, but you cannot easily cool a hot room. |
| Darkness | Total blackout. Cover every LED. Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask. If you can see your hand in front of your face, it is not dark enough. |
| Sound | Consistent low-level white noise or silence. Fan, white noise machine, or earplugs. No TV, no music with lyrics, no podcasts. |
| Mattress | Medium-firm. Your spine should maintain its natural curve when lying on your side. Replace every 8–10 years. |
| Pillow | Supports the neck without tilting the head up or down. Side sleepers need a thicker pillow than back sleepers. Replace yearly. |
| Bedding | Breathable materials: cotton or linen sheets. Skip synthetic fabrics — they trap heat. Use layers you can adjust. |
| Phone | In another room. Not on the nightstand. Not on airplane mode on the nightstand. In another room. |
| Clock | Face it away from you or remove it. Clock-watching increases sleep anxiety. Your alarm still works facing the wall. |

## Morning Routine

| Time | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 6:00 AM | Alarm goes off. One alarm. Get up immediately. No snooze — snoozing fragments the last sleep cycle and makes you groggier. |
| 6:00 AM | Open curtains or step outside. Get bright light in your eyes within 2 minutes of waking. Overcast days still work — outdoor light is 10–100x brighter than indoor light. |
| 6:05 AM | Drink a full glass of water. You are dehydrated from 8 hours without fluids. |
| 6:10 AM | Light movement: 5 minutes of walking, stretching, or bodyweight exercises. This raises core temperature and signals your circadian system that the day has started. |
| 7:30 AM | Earliest caffeine. Wait 90 minutes after waking before coffee or tea. Adenosine needs to clear naturally first; caffeine too early masks residual sleep inertia and can cause an afternoon crash. |

**Do not:**
- Hit snooze. Ever. Set the alarm for the actual time you will get up.
- Check your phone first. Light exposure and water come before screens.
- Skip the outdoor light. This is the strongest circadian signal available. It anchors your entire sleep–wake cycle.

## Weekend Rules

**Same bedtime, same wake time.** No exceptions. Social jet lag — staying up late Friday and sleeping in Saturday — shifts your circadian clock by 1–2 hours per day of deviation. Sleeping in on Sunday morning is equivalent to flying two time zones east on Sunday night. Monday's alarm will feel terrible not because you are tired, but because your internal clock is misaligned. See [daily schedule structure](/time/index.md) for fitting this into weekly planning.

If you went to bed late (social event, travel), still wake up at your normal time. You will be slightly tired that day. Go to bed at your normal time that night. One bad night recovers in one day if you hold the schedule. Two or more days of shifting takes a week to repair.

**Alcohol exception:** If you drank alcohol, accept that your sleep quality will be poor regardless of what else you do. See [Alcohol](#alcohol). Do not try to compensate by sleeping longer — the extra hours will be low-quality. Wake up on schedule and move on.

# Comprehensive Sleep Guide

## Sleep Architecture

Sleep cycles through stages in roughly 90-minute blocks, with 4–6 complete cycles per night.

| Stage | Duration per Cycle | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| N1 (Light Sleep) | 5–10 min | Transition stage. Easily disrupted. Not restorative. |
| N2 (Light Sleep) | 10–25 min | Memory consolidation, motor learning. Makes up ~50% of total sleep. |
| N3 (Deep/Slow-Wave Sleep) | 20–40 min | Tissue repair, growth hormone release, immune function. Dominates early cycles. |
| REM (Rapid Eye Movement) | 10–60 min | Emotional processing, creativity, procedural memory. Dominates later cycles. |

**Why this matters for recovery:** Deep sleep (N3) is when growth hormone peaks and muscle protein synthesis is highest. A lifter sleeping 6 hours gets roughly the same deep sleep as one sleeping 8 hours, but significantly less REM — which handles emotional regulation and motor learning. The first casualty of sleep loss is not physical recovery. It is mood, motivation, and decision-making.

**Cycle structure:** Deep sleep concentrates in the first half of the night. REM concentrates in the second half. Going to bed late cuts deep sleep. Waking up early cuts REM. Neither is acceptable if you can avoid it.

## Circadian Rhythm Management

Your circadian clock is a 24-hour internal timer that regulates when you feel alert and when you feel sleepy. It is anchored by **zeitgebers** (time-givers), the strongest being light exposure, meal timing, and body temperature.

**Light exposure.** The single most powerful input. Morning bright light (10,000+ lux) within 30 minutes of waking advances the clock and triggers cortisol release, which drives alertness. Evening dim light allows melatonin to rise. Get 10 minutes of direct outdoor light in the morning, even on overcast days. Outdoor overcast light is ~10,000 lux; a bright indoor room is ~500 lux. There is no indoor substitute for outdoor light.

**Meal timing.** Your liver and gut have their own circadian clocks, synchronized by when you eat. Eating within a consistent 10–12 hour window each day reinforces the central clock. A large meal within 2 hours of bedtime raises core temperature and demands digestive energy, both of which oppose sleep onset. Last substantial meal by 8:00 PM. See [nutrition timing](/nutrition/index.md) for how meal windows interact with training.

**Core body temperature.** Your body needs to drop 1–2°F to initiate sleep. Temperature peaks in the late afternoon and troughs in the early morning. A hot shower or bath 1–2 hours before bed paradoxically helps: it vasodilates the skin, accelerating heat loss after you get out — this is why the [Base Program](#evening-routine) includes a shower at 8:45 PM. Cool the bedroom to 65°F. Warm socks are fine — peripheral warmth promotes core cooling by shunting blood to the extremities.

## Sleep Environment

**Mattress.** Medium-firm is the evidence-based default. Too soft causes spinal misalignment. Too firm creates pressure points that cause tossing. If you wake with back pain that resolves within 30 minutes, your mattress is too soft. If you wake with hip or shoulder soreness, it may be too firm. Mattress pads and toppers can fine-tune firmness without replacement. Material hierarchy for sleep temperature: latex (best airflow) > innerspring/hybrid > memory foam (worst airflow). [Memory foam toppers] removed: they trap heat and degrade faster than latex alternatives.

**Pillow.** The goal is a neutral cervical spine. Side sleepers need a pillow thick enough to fill the gap between the shoulder and the ear. Back sleepers need a thinner pillow that supports the neck curve without pushing the head forward. Stomach sleeping strains the cervical spine — train yourself out of it by placing a body pillow along your side. [Specialty pillows (cooling gel, contour, etc.)] removed: a properly fitted standard pillow in breathable material does the same job for less money.

**Temperature.** 65°F (18°C). This is not a suggestion. Sleep onset requires core temperature to drop; a warm room prevents this. If you share a bed with someone who runs hot, use separate blankets. A fan provides both cooling and white noise. [Bed cooling systems (ChiliPad, Eight Sleep)] removed: effective but expensive; a cooler room with appropriate bedding achieves the same result for most people.

**Sound.** Consistent, low-frequency white or pink noise masks environmental disruptions without triggering arousal. A fan is ideal. A dedicated white noise machine is acceptable. [Sleep playlists and apps] removed: they require a phone in the bedroom, which is a greater disruptor than the noise problem they solve.

**Light.** Total darkness. Even small amounts of ambient light (hallway light under the door, streetlights through thin curtains, device LEDs) suppress melatonin and reduce deep sleep even if you do not consciously wake. Blackout curtains plus electrical tape over LEDs. A sleep mask is a portable backup, not the primary solution.

## Evening Wind-Down Protocol

The 90-minute wind-down in the [Base Program](#evening-routine) exists because sleep onset is not an event — it is a process. Melatonin begins rising 2–3 hours before sleep, and bright light or stimulating activity can suppress or delay it.

**Screen management.** The primary problem with screens before bed is cognitive stimulation, not blue light. Social media, news, email, and games activate the sympathetic nervous system. Blue-enriched light does suppress melatonin — night mode and blue-light glasses reduce but do not eliminate this — but even a dimmed, filtered screen keeps the mind engaged. The fix is removing the screen, not filtering the light. Physical phone separation (another room) is dramatically more effective than willpower-based screen limits.

**Stimulant cutoffs.** See [Caffeine](#caffeine) for the full pharmacology. The short version: no caffeine after 2:00 PM. This means no coffee, no tea (except herbal), no pre-workout, no dark chocolate in meaningful quantities. Caffeine's half-life is 5–6 hours, but its quarter-life (time to 25% remaining) is 10–12 hours. A 2:00 PM coffee still has pharmacologically active caffeine in your system at 10:00 PM.

**Relaxation techniques.** If you do one thing: 5 minutes of slow diaphragmatic breathing before lights-out. Inhale 4 seconds through the nose, hold 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds through the mouth. This activates the parasympathetic nervous system directly. [Guided meditations and sleep apps] removed: they require a phone in the bedroom. [Sleep supplements (magnesium, L-theanine, valerian)] removed: fix the environment and behavior first; supplements cannot overcome a broken routine.

## Morning Wake Protocol

Morning behavior sets the circadian clock for the entire day. The [Base Program morning routine](#morning-routine) covers the exact sequence. Here is the reasoning.

**Light exposure.** Bright morning light triggers the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's master clock, to start the cortisol awakening response and begin the countdown to melatonin release ~14–16 hours later. This means 6:00 AM light exposure programs melatonin onset at 8:00–10:00 PM. Without this signal, the clock drifts later each day. Direct outdoor light is non-negotiable — even 5 minutes matters. A 10,000-lux light therapy lamp is an acceptable second-best for dark winter mornings.

**Caffeine timing.** Adenosine, the molecule that builds sleep pressure, is still elevated when you wake. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors. Drinking coffee immediately masks sleep inertia temporarily, but when the caffeine wears off mid-morning, the residual adenosine hits all at once. Waiting 90 minutes lets adenosine clear naturally, and caffeine then extends alertness instead of creating a rebound crash. This effect varies by individual — if you cannot function without immediate caffeine, you are likely not sleeping enough.

**Movement.** Light physical activity raises core body temperature, which is the strongest wake signal after light. It does not need to be a workout — walking, stretching, or a few bodyweight movements are sufficient. Save [training](/lift/index.md) for later; hard exercise within 30 minutes of waking elevates cortisol when it is already peaking and provides no additional wake benefit.

## Napping

Napping is a tool, not a habit. Used correctly, it restores alertness. Used incorrectly, it fragments nighttime sleep.

| Nap Type | Duration | Best For | Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Power nap | 10–20 min | Afternoon alertness boost | Minimal. Set an alarm. |
| Full cycle | 90 min | Recovery from severe sleep debt | May delay sleep onset that night. |
| Micro nap | 5–10 min | Emergency reset (driving, studying) | None. |

**Rules:**
- Nap before 2:00 PM. After 2:00 PM, any nap bleeds into nighttime sleep pressure.
- Set an alarm. Napping without an alarm risks falling into deep sleep, producing severe grogginess (sleep inertia) that lasts 30+ minutes.
- 20 minutes maximum for routine naps. You will stay in N1/N2, wake easily, and feel refreshed.
- 90 minutes if you need a full cycle (illness, extreme sleep debt). Anything between 20 and 90 minutes risks waking during deep sleep, which is worse than not napping.
- If you need to nap daily, you are not sleeping enough at night. Fix the root cause.

[Caffeine naps (coffee + 20-minute nap)] removed: the timing is too tight for practical use, and it requires caffeine in the afternoon, which conflicts with the [2:00 PM cutoff](#evening-wind-down-protocol).

# Sleep Disruptors Reference

Each entry describes the mechanism, severity, and practical mitigation. Severity is rated on a 3-point scale: **high** (measurably degrades sleep architecture), **moderate** (reduces subjective quality or delays onset), **low** (minor or inconsistent effect).

## Substances

### Caffeine

**Mechanism:** Blocks adenosine receptors, preventing the detection of sleep pressure. Does not eliminate adenosine — it accumulates behind the blockade and hits when caffeine clears.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Onset | 15–45 min |
| Peak plasma | 30–60 min |
| Half-life | 5–6 hours (range: 3–9 hours depending on genetics, liver function, oral contraceptives) |
| Quarter-life | 10–12 hours |
| Full clearance | ~24 hours |

**Severity:** High. Even when subjects report sleeping fine after late caffeine, polysomnography shows reduced deep sleep (N3) by 15–20%. You do not feel the loss — you have adapted to chronically impaired sleep.

**Mitigation:** No caffeine after 2:00 PM. Cap daily intake at 400 mg (~4 cups of coffee). If you are a slow metabolizer (caffeine makes you jittery for hours), cut off at noon. Track your intake — caffeine is in tea, chocolate, pre-workout, soda, and some medications.

### Alcohol

**Mechanism:** Alcohol is a sedative, not a sleep aid. It accelerates sleep onset but fragments the second half of the night by disrupting REM sleep as the liver metabolizes it. The metabolic byproduct acetaldehyde is a stimulant. Result: you fall asleep faster but wake more often, spend less time in REM, and experience increased sympathetic nervous system activation (elevated heart rate, sweating).

**Severity:** High. Two or more drinks within 3 hours of bedtime reduce REM by 20–40%. Even one drink measurably alters sleep architecture.

**Mitigation:** Stop drinking at least 3 hours before bed. One drink has minimal impact if consumed at dinner (6–7 PM). There is no mitigation for heavy drinking — accept the degraded night and protect the next day's schedule. [Nightcaps] removed: the worst possible timing for alcohol relative to sleep.

### Nicotine

**Mechanism:** Stimulant that increases heart rate and alertness. Withdrawal during the night causes micro-arousals, especially in the second half of the night.

**Severity:** Moderate. Smokers take longer to fall asleep, sleep lighter, and wake earlier than non-smokers. Withdrawal symptoms disrupt the second half of the night.

**Mitigation:** Do not use nicotine within 2 hours of bedtime. If you smoke, quitting is the single largest sleep improvement available to you. Nicotine patches worn overnight can disrupt sleep — remove them before bed.

### Cannabis

**Mechanism:** THC is sedating at low doses and anxiolytic, which can help with sleep onset. However, it suppresses REM sleep dose-dependently. CBD has mild anxiolytic effects without significant REM suppression, but evidence is weaker.

**Severity:** Moderate. Sleep onset may improve, but REM suppression means less emotional processing and procedural memory consolidation. Chronic use causes tolerance, and cessation causes REM rebound (vivid dreams, fragmented sleep) for 1–2 weeks.

**Mitigation:** If used, lowest effective dose, THC-only or low-THC/high-CBD, at least 2 hours before bed. Do not rely on it nightly — tolerance builds within days. Expect 1–2 weeks of poor sleep when stopping.

### Melatonin

**Mechanism:** Melatonin is a timing signal, not a sedative. It tells the brain "it is nighttime" and shifts the circadian clock. Exogenous melatonin is useful for jet lag and circadian phase shifting, not for general insomnia.

**Severity:** Low (as a disruptor). Not harmful, but most people misuse it. Standard doses (3–10 mg) are 10–30x the physiological amount and can cause morning grogginess and circadian confusion.

**Mitigation:** Take 0.3–0.5 mg (not 5 mg, not 10 mg) 30–60 minutes before target bedtime. Use it for jet lag recovery or deliberate phase shifting, not as a nightly sleep aid. If you need melatonin every night, the problem is your light exposure and schedule, not your melatonin levels.

## Technology

### Screens and Blue Light

**Mechanism:** Screens emit blue-enriched light (460–480 nm) that activates melanopsin receptors in the retina, signaling the SCN to suppress melatonin. One hour of screen use before bed delays melatonin onset by approximately 30 minutes. However, the cognitive stimulation from content is at least as disruptive as the light itself.

**Severity:** High. Both light and content contribute. Blue-light glasses reduce the light component by 50–80% but do nothing about cognitive arousal — the larger problem.

**Mitigation:** No screens after 8:30 PM. Phone in another room. If you must use a screen (work emergency), use the dimmest setting, night mode, and keep the session under 15 minutes. [Blue-light glasses as primary mitigation] removed: they address the smaller component of the problem (light) and ignore the larger one (stimulation).

### Notifications

**Mechanism:** Auditory and visual alerts trigger the orienting response, a brainstem-mediated startle that elevates cortisol and heart rate. A single 3 AM notification can fragment a sleep cycle even if you do not fully wake.

**Severity:** Moderate to high. A single alert matters less than the hypervigilance of knowing one could arrive.

**Mitigation:** Phone in another room on Do Not Disturb. If you use your phone as an alarm, buy a $10 alarm clock and remove the excuse. [Bedside phone on silent] removed: the screen still lights up, and the temptation to check remains.

### Bedroom TV

**Mechanism:** Combines blue light, cognitive stimulation, and inconsistent noise. Falling asleep to a TV means light and sound continue through early sleep cycles, reducing N3 depth. Many people report "needing" it to sleep — this is a trained association, not a physiological requirement.

**Severity:** Moderate. Less damaging than a phone because content is passive, but the light exposure alone is significant.

**Mitigation:** Remove the TV from the bedroom. If you are unwilling, use a sleep timer set to 30 minutes and accept reduced sleep quality. The bedroom is for sleep. Train new associations.

## Behavioral

### Irregular Schedule

**Mechanism:** The circadian clock takes 1–2 days to shift per hour of change. Varying bedtime and wake time by even 1 hour creates chronic circadian misalignment, similar to perpetual mild jet lag. The SCN never fully synchronizes, leading to fragmented sleep and daytime fatigue even with adequate total sleep hours.

**Severity:** High. Social jet lag is strongly correlated with metabolic dysfunction, impaired glucose tolerance, and increased body fat independent of total sleep duration.

**Mitigation:** Fixed bedtime and wake time, 7 days a week. See [Weekend Rules](#weekend-rules). This is the single highest-leverage behavior change for sleep quality.

### Late Exercise

**Mechanism:** Vigorous exercise raises core temperature, heart rate, and cortisol for 1–2 hours post-session. Sleep onset requires declining core temperature and parasympathetic dominance. [Training](/lift/index.md) too close to bed opposes both.

**Severity:** Moderate. Low-to-moderate exercise (walking, stretching, yoga) in the evening is fine and may help. High-intensity or heavy resistance training within 2 hours of bed can delay sleep onset significantly.

**Mitigation:** Finish intense training at least 2 hours before bedtime. Morning or afternoon training is optimal for sleep. If evening is the only option, keep it moderate and allow a 2-hour buffer.

### Late Meals

**Mechanism:** Digestion raises core temperature and diverts blood flow to the gut. Large, high-fat, or high-protein meals within 2 hours of bed increase sleep onset latency and reduce deep sleep. See [nutrition timing](/nutrition/index.md).

**Severity:** Moderate. A light snack (under 200 calories, low glycemic index) is fine and may prevent hunger-driven waking. A full meal is the problem.

**Mitigation:** Last substantial meal by 8:00 PM (2 hours before a 10:00 PM bedtime). If genuinely hungry later, a small snack of casein protein or complex carbs is acceptable.

### Stress and Rumination

**Mechanism:** Anxiety and unresolved mental loops activate the sympathetic nervous system, elevating cortisol and preventing the shift to parasympathetic dominance needed for sleep onset. The default mode network becomes hyperactive, producing racing thoughts. See [mental health strategies](/mental/index.md) for broader approaches.

**Severity:** High. Rumination is the most common cause of sleep onset insomnia in otherwise healthy adults. It can add 30–90 minutes to time-to-sleep.

**Mitigation:** Brain dump before bed (write tasks and worries on paper, close the notebook). Structured wind-down that replaces rumination with low-stimulation activity. Diaphragmatic breathing (4-4-6 pattern). If chronic, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment — more effective than any medication. [Journaling apps] removed: phone in bedroom. Use paper.

## Environmental

### Temperature (Too Warm)

**Mechanism:** Sleep onset requires a 1–2°F core temperature drop. A room above 68°F impairs the body's ability to radiate heat, delaying onset and increasing nighttime awakenings. Warm environments also increase time spent in light sleep at the expense of deep sleep.

**Severity:** High. Room temperature is one of the strongest environmental predictors of sleep quality, second only to light.

**Mitigation:** Set the thermostat to 65°F (18°C). Use a fan. Wear light or no clothing. Use breathable bedding. If you share a bed and disagree on temperature, err cold and let the warm-preference partner add blankets.

### Light Pollution

**Mechanism:** Any visible light during sleep suppresses melatonin and reduces deep sleep duration. The retina detects light even through closed eyelids. Streetlights, hallway light, and device LEDs all contribute.

**Severity:** High. Even dim ambient light in the bedroom reduces deep sleep compared to total darkness.

**Mitigation:** Blackout curtains. Electrical tape over every LED. Sleep mask as a backup. If you need to navigate at night (bathroom), use a motion-activated floor-level red light — red wavelengths suppress melatonin the least.

### Noise

**Mechanism:** Sudden or variable noise triggers the cortical arousal response even during sleep, causing micro-awakenings that fragment sleep architecture without full waking. You do not remember these arousals, but they degrade sleep quality. Consistent noise (white noise, fan) does not trigger this response and can mask disruptive sounds.

**Severity:** Moderate to high, depending on variability. Steady traffic noise is less disruptive than intermittent traffic. A snoring partner is highly disruptive due to irregular volume patterns.

**Mitigation:** White noise machine or fan. Earplugs for high-noise environments (rated NRR 25+ for meaningful reduction). Address the noise source when possible (fix the snoring, move the bedroom away from the street). Foam earplugs are cheap and effective; silicone putty earplugs are more comfortable for side sleepers.

### Partner Disruption

**Mechanism:** Combines multiple disruptors: movement transfer through the mattress, snoring (variable noise), different temperature preferences, different schedules, and covers-stealing.

**Severity:** Moderate. Bed partners cause an average of 30 minutes of disrupted sleep per night compared to sleeping alone, though subjective reports often underestimate this because people habituate.

**Mitigation:** Separate blankets (Scandinavian method). A mattress with good motion isolation (foam or hybrid over innerspring). Earplugs for the non-snoring partner. If schedules differ by more than 1 hour, consider a separate sleep space — this is sleep optimization, not a relationship problem.

# Sleep Tracking and Assessment

## Subjective Measures

These are the metrics that actually matter. Track them daily for 2 weeks to establish a baseline. Use a simple notebook by the bed (not a phone app). Each morning, spend 30 seconds recording:

| Field | Format | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bedtime | Time | 10:00 PM |
| Wake time | Time | 6:00 AM |
| Time to fall asleep | Minutes | ~10 min |
| Nighttime awakenings | Count + total duration | 1x, ~5 min |
| Morning alertness (1–5) | Rating | 4 |
| Daytime energy (1–5) | Rating | 4 |
| Notes | Free text | Had coffee at 3 PM, took longer to fall asleep |

After 2 weeks, patterns emerge that no wearable can match. The notes column is the most valuable — it connects behaviors to outcomes.

**Sleep onset latency.** How long it takes to fall asleep. Target: under 15 minutes. Over 30 minutes consistently indicates a problem — either circadian misalignment, insufficient sleep pressure, or hyperarousal. Under 5 minutes consistently indicates sleep deprivation (you are so tired you crash instantly).

**Nighttime awakenings.** Brief awakenings (under 5 minutes) between cycles are normal. Awakenings where you are fully conscious for 15+ minutes, or more than twice per night, are worth investigating.

**Morning alertness.** You should feel reasonably alert within 20 minutes of waking. If you feel groggy for 60+ minutes daily (after an adequate sleep period), suspect poor sleep quality, circadian misalignment, or a sleep disorder.

**Daytime energy.** Consistent energy from mid-morning through early evening without caffeine propping you up. An afternoon dip (2:00–3:00 PM) is normal circadian biology, not a sign of poor sleep. Inability to stay awake during meetings, while driving, or while reading is a red flag.

**Mood and irritability.** Sleep deprivation degrades emotional regulation before it degrades physical performance. If you are consistently irritable, anxious, or unmotivated despite adequate [training](/lift/index.md) and [nutrition](/nutrition/index.md), sleep is the most likely culprit.

## Objective Measures

**Sleep duration.** Track bedtime and wake time, not "time in bed." An 8-hour sleep opportunity with 30 minutes of onset latency and 30 minutes of nighttime waking yields 7 hours of actual sleep.

**Resting heart rate.** Elevated morning resting heart rate (5+ bpm above your personal baseline) often indicates poor sleep quality, overtraining, illness, or alcohol the night before. Track via a wrist-based monitor or manual pulse check. The trend matters more than any single reading.

**Heart rate variability (HRV).** Higher HRV generally indicates better recovery. A sustained drop in HRV below your 2-week rolling average suggests accumulated stress or poor sleep. Measure at the same time daily (morning, supine) for valid comparisons.

## What to Ignore

**Sleep stage breakdowns from consumer wearables.** Wrist-based devices (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura, Whoop) are reasonably accurate for total sleep time (within 20–30 minutes) but poor at distinguishing sleep stages. Their deep sleep and REM numbers are estimates, not measurements. Do not optimize your behavior around stage data from a wrist sensor.

**Sleep scores.** Composite scores flatten nuance into a single number that rewards lying still in bed. A night where you slept well but woke to use the bathroom might score lower than a night where you passed out from exhaustion. Use subjective measures instead.

**Night-to-night variation.** A single bad night is noise. Sleep quality varies naturally. Track 7-day averages for trends. React to sustained patterns (a full week of poor sleep), not individual nights.

[Polysomnography at home] removed: lab-grade sleep studies are the gold standard, but they are for diagnosing disorders under medical supervision, not for optimizing healthy sleep. If you suspect a sleep disorder, see a doctor; do not try to self-diagnose with consumer equipment.

# Factors for Sleep Decisions

There is no universally optimal sleep schedule. The best routine depends on your biology, training demands, and life constraints. The factors below serve as evaluation criteria for adapting the [Base Program](#base-program) to your situation.

| Category | Factor | Key Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Chronotype](#chronotype) | Morning vs. Evening Preference | Should I shift my sleep window earlier or later? |
| [Training Load](#training-load) | Recovery Demands | Do I need more than 8 hours after heavy training blocks? |
| [Work Schedule](#work-schedule) | Schedule Constraints | How do I manage shift work, travel, or irregular hours? |
| [Life Stage](#life-stage) | Age-Related Changes | How does aging change my sleep needs and structure? |
| [Sleep Disorders](#sleep-disorders) | Medical Conditions | Is this a habit problem or a medical problem? |
| [Individual Variation](#individual-variation) | Genetic Differences | Am I a short sleeper or a slow caffeine metabolizer? |

## Chronotype

Your chronotype — whether you are naturally an early bird or a night owl — is largely genetic (driven by the PER3 gene, among others) and not a discipline problem. Forcing a strong night owl onto a 9:30 PM bedtime creates chronic misalignment without improving sleep quality.

**Adaptation:** Shift the [Base Program](#base-program) sleep window to match your chronotype while keeping the 8-hour duration and all other protocols intact.

| Chronotype | Suggested Window | Morning Light Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Strong morning | 9:00 PM – 5:00 AM | 5:00 AM |
| Moderate morning | 9:30 PM – 5:30 AM | 5:30 AM |
| Neutral | 10:00 PM – 6:00 AM | 6:00 AM |
| Moderate evening | 10:30 PM – 6:30 AM | 6:30 AM |
| Strong evening | 11:00 PM – 7:00 AM | 7:00 AM |

If you do not know your chronotype: when do you naturally wake without an alarm on vacation after a week of no obligations? That is your biology. Work with it.

**Limits:** Even strong evening types should avoid sleeping past 8:00 AM regularly — morning light exposure becomes difficult to time correctly, and social obligations create unavoidable friction. If your natural rhythm is midnight–8:00 AM, you can try to gradually advance it with morning light exposure and earlier meal timing, but expect a 30–60 minute shift at most.

## Training Load

Heavy [training](/lift/index.md) increases sleep need. This is not optional — it is physiological. Growth hormone release during deep sleep scales with training volume, and inflammatory markers from muscle damage require sleep-dependent immune processes to resolve.

**Guidelines:**
- Base training (3–4 moderate sessions/week): 7.5–8 hours is sufficient.
- High volume (5–6 sessions/week, or intensification blocks): 8–9 hours. Add 30 minutes to your sleep window.
- Competition prep or overreaching phases: 9+ hours. Napping becomes a useful tool here.
- Deload weeks: Return to 8 hours. Sleep quality often improves markedly during deloads — this is the recovery actually happening.

If you are training hard and stalling on lifts despite good [nutrition](/nutrition/index.md), add 30 minutes of sleep before adjusting programming. Sleep is the cheapest, most effective recovery tool available. A single night of 5 hours reduces next-day voluntary training intensity by ~10% and reaction time by ~15%, while perceived exertion rises and actual output drops. Two nights compound the effect.

## Work Schedule

**Shift work.** Rotating shifts are the worst-case scenario for circadian health. If you work nights: make the bedroom completely dark during daytime sleep, wear blue-blocking glasses during the morning commute home, and keep a fixed sleep schedule on work days even if it means sleeping 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM. On days off, decide whether to maintain the shifted schedule or revert — constantly switching is worse than either option held consistently. There is no good answer for rotating shifts. Minimize the damage by anchoring the largest block of sleep to the same time as many days as possible.

**Travel and jet lag.** Eastward travel is harder than westward because it requires advancing the clock (going to bed earlier), which is harder than delaying. General rule: it takes one day per time zone to fully adjust.

| Phase | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Before (3–5 days) | Shift bedtime 30 min/day toward destination time. Shift morning light exposure to match. |
| Travel day | Stay hydrated. Avoid alcohol on the flight. Set your watch to destination time at departure. |
| Arrival | Get bright outdoor light at the local morning time. Eat meals on local schedule. |
| First 3–5 nights | Take 0.3–0.5 mg melatonin 30 min before target bedtime. Maintain local meal and light schedule. |
| Recovery | Stop melatonin once sleeping through the night. Expect 1 day per time zone for full adjustment. |

**Irregular hours.** If your schedule varies but is not true shift work (freelancers, new parents, on-call professions): protect the wake time above all else. Bedtime can flex by 30–60 minutes, but waking at the same time daily is the anchor that prevents circadian drift. See [time management strategies](/time/index.md) for structuring variable schedules.

## Life Stage

Sleep architecture changes with age. These changes are normal, not pathological.

| Age Range | Typical Changes |
| :--- | :--- |
| 18–25 | Highest deep sleep proportion. Natural circadian phase delay (night owl tendency). Can tolerate sleep debt somewhat. |
| 26–40 | Deep sleep begins declining (~2% per decade). Sleep efficiency remains high. Recovery demands increase with training. |
| 41–55 | Deep sleep declines further. More nighttime awakenings. Melatonin production decreases. Sleep becomes lighter. |
| 55+ | Deep sleep may be 50–60% of young-adult levels. Sleep is more fragmented. Earlier chronotype shift. Total need does not decrease — the ability to sleep continuously does. |

**Adaptation:** Older adults should prioritize sleep hygiene more strictly because the margin for error shrinks. The same disruption (one drink, a warm room, a late screen session) that a 25-year-old barely notices may cost a 50-year-old an hour of quality sleep.

## Sleep Disorders

Some sleep problems are not habit problems. If you have followed the [Base Program](#base-program) for 4 weeks with strict compliance and still experience significant issues, see a doctor. Self-diagnosis with consumer devices is not a substitute for a clinical sleep study.

**See a doctor if:**
- You snore loudly and/or your partner reports you stop breathing during sleep (suspect obstructive sleep apnea).
- You fall asleep uncontrollably during the day despite adequate nighttime sleep (suspect narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia).
- You experience irresistible urges to move your legs, especially at rest in the evening (suspect restless leg syndrome).
- You consistently cannot fall asleep or stay asleep despite strict adherence to sleep hygiene for 4+ weeks (suspect chronic insomnia — CBT-I is first-line treatment, not medication).
- You act out dreams physically (suspect REM sleep behavior disorder — see a neurologist).

**Do not self-medicate.** Over-the-counter sleep aids (diphenhydramine, doxylamine) are antihistamines that cause sedation, not sleep. They suppress REM, cause morning grogginess, and lose effectiveness within 2 weeks of nightly use. Prescription sleep medications (benzodiazepines, Z-drugs) carry dependency risk and do not produce normal sleep architecture. CBT-I is the evidence-based first-line treatment for chronic insomnia and has no side effects.

## Individual Variation

**Sleep need.** The 8-hour recommendation fits ~68% of the population (one standard deviation around the mean of 7.5–8 hours). Genuine short sleepers (functioning well on 6 hours without caffeine compensation) exist but represent less than 3% of the population, driven by mutations in the DEC2 and ADRB1 genes. If you think you are a short sleeper, you are almost certainly not. Test: sleep without an alarm for 2 weeks on vacation. Your average wake time reveals your actual need.

**Caffeine sensitivity.** CYP1A2 gene variants determine caffeine metabolism speed. Fast metabolizers clear caffeine in 3–4 hours and can tolerate later intake. Slow metabolizers take 8–9 hours and should cut off caffeine by noon. You likely already know which you are — if an afternoon coffee keeps you up, you are a slow metabolizer. Adjust the [2:00 PM cutoff](#evening-wind-down-protocol) accordingly.

**Environmental sensitivity.** Some people sleep through anything; others wake at every sound. This is partly genetic (light sleep architecture) and partly conditioned. High-sensitivity sleepers should invest more in sound masking (white noise, earplugs) and light blocking. Low-sensitivity sleepers still benefit from these measures — they improve sleep quality even when they do not prevent waking.

**Alcohol sensitivity.** Individual variation in alcohol metabolism (ADH and ALDH enzyme variants) means the same two drinks will disrupt one person's sleep dramatically and another's minimally. Observe your own response. If your resting heart rate is elevated the morning after even moderate drinking, your sleep was significantly disrupted regardless of how you felt.
