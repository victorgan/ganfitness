# Base Program

A weekly structure for someone with a full-time job, training goals, and a life outside work. Do exactly this for four weeks before customizing. Every block, ritual, and rest period is specified. Time management is zero-sum: choosing to protect one block means something else does not happen. This program makes those tradeoffs explicit.

The schedule assumes a 9-to-5-ish knowledge work job. If your hours are different, shift the blocks but preserve the gaps between them.

## Weekly Planning Ritual

**When:** Sunday, 4:00-4:30 PM. Not negotiable.

**Process:**
1. Review last week. Open your calendar and scan Monday through Sunday. What got done? What slipped? Note one thing that went well and one that didn't. (2 min)
2. Check upcoming obligations. Scan the next 7 days for fixed commitments: meetings, appointments, deadlines, social plans. Write them down. (3 min)
3. Identify your three weekly priorities. Not tasks -- outcomes. "Finish the proposal draft" not "work on proposal." Three is the limit. If everything is a priority, nothing is. (5 min)
4. Assign priorities to days. Each priority gets at least one [deep work block](#deep-work) assigned to a specific day. Put them on the calendar. (5 min)
5. Schedule training, meal prep, and sleep. These go on the calendar as fixed blocks, same as meetings. They are not optional. (5 min)
6. Identify one social commitment. At minimum, plan one meaningful interaction with someone you care about. See [social guidance](/social/index.md) for why this matters. (2 min)
7. Identify what you are not doing this week. Write it down. This is the most important step. Explicitly deciding what to skip prevents the guilt of undone tasks from fragmenting your focus. (3 min)
8. Set Monday's tasks. Write three specific tasks for tomorrow morning so you can start without decision-making. (5 min)

## Daily Structure

**6:00 AM** -- Wake up. Same time every day, including weekends. Consistency matters more than the exact hour. See [sleep guidance](/sleep/index.md) for why.

**6:00-6:30** -- Morning routine. No screens for the first 15 minutes. Coffee or tea, brief movement (walk, stretch, bodyweight), review today's three tasks from last night's plan. No email. No news. No social media.

**6:30-8:30** -- Deep work block 1. Work on your highest-priority task. Phone on airplane mode or in another room. Close email, Slack, and all notifications. Two hours minimum. If your job requires you to be online at 7 AM, shift this block earlier (5:30-7:30) or later (after the morning communication window). Do your most important work before the world starts demanding your attention.

**8:30-9:00** -- Transition and shallow work. Process email and messages. Respond to anything urgent. Batch quick tasks (under 2 minutes each). This is your communication window, not your work window.

**9:00-12:00** -- Work block 2. Meetings, collaborative work, or a second deep work session if your calendar allows. This block is more flexible because most jobs require availability during core hours.

**12:00-1:00** -- Lunch. Eat away from your desk. Walk if possible. This is recovery, not free time to catch up on work.

**1:00-3:00** -- Work block 3. Tackle your second or third priority. Energy dips after lunch for most people, so this is a good slot for structured but less creative work: code reviews, editing, admin, research.

**3:00-3:15** -- Break. Stand up. Walk. Get water. Do not check social media -- it will cost you 15 minutes, not 2.

**3:15-5:00** -- Work block 4. Finish the day's tasks. Start wrapping up at 4:30 -- tie off loose ends and write tomorrow's three tasks. Do not start new work after 4:30.

**5:00-5:30** -- Shutdown ritual. Review what got done. Write tomorrow's three tasks if you haven't. Close all work tabs. Say "shutdown complete" out loud or write it down. This sounds silly. It works. The ritual creates a boundary between work and non-work that your brain respects over time.

**5:30-7:00** -- Training or personal time. Gym, run, cook dinner, errands. This block moves based on your [training schedule](/lift/index.md#base-program).

**7:00-9:00** -- Evening. Dinner, social time, hobbies, reading, whatever matters to you. No work. If you are working in this block regularly, something is wrong with your daytime structure or your workload, and the fix is upstream.

**9:00-9:30** -- Wind-down. Dim lights, no screens (or use night mode), light reading, stretching. See [sleep wind-down protocol](/sleep/index.md) for details.

**9:30 PM** -- In bed. Target 7-9 hours of sleep. This is not negotiable.

## Sample Week

A realistic week for someone with a full-time job, training 6 days per the [lifting Base Program](/lift/index.md#base-program), meal prepping on Sundays, and maintaining a social life. Not every week will look this clean. The goal is a default structure to return to, not a rigid schedule to stress about.

This deviates from the lifting Base Program's default schedule (which puts Lower B on Friday and Conditioning B on Saturday) by stacking both on Saturday morning to free Friday evening for social time.

| Time | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 6:00 | Wake, routine | Wake, routine | Wake, routine | Wake, routine | Wake, routine | Wake, routine | Sleep in to 7:30 |
| 6:30-8:30 | Deep work | Deep work | Deep work | Deep work | Deep work | Lower B + Cond. B | -- |
| 8:30-9:00 | Email/Slack | Email/Slack | Email/Slack | Email/Slack | Email/Slack | Done by 8:30 | Morning routine |
| 9:00-12:00 | Work (meetings) | Work | Work (meetings) | Work | Work | Free time | Weekly planning 4 PM |
| 12:00-1:00 | Lunch + walk | Lunch + walk | Lunch + walk | Lunch + walk | Lunch + walk | Lunch | Lunch |
| 1:00-5:00 | Work | Work | Work | Work | Work (wrap up 3:30) | Social plans | Meal prep, rest |
| 5:00-5:30 | Shutdown | Shutdown | Shutdown | Shutdown | Shutdown | -- | -- |
| 5:30-7:00 | Upper A (lift) | Lower A (lift) | Conditioning A | Upper B (lift) | Social / free | -- | -- |
| 7:00-9:00 | Dinner, read | Dinner, hobby | Dinner, social | Dinner, read | Dinner out | Evening plans | Dinner, wind down |
| 9:30 | Bed | Bed | Bed | Bed | Bed | Bed (10:30 OK) | Bed |

**Notes on this schedule:**
- Training aligns with the [lifting Base Program](/lift/index.md#base-program): Upper A Monday, Lower A Tuesday, Conditioning A Wednesday, Upper B Thursday -- all after work. Lower B (55-65 min) and Conditioning B (20-30 min) stack on Saturday morning starting at 6:30, finishing by roughly 8:15. If you prefer the lift doc's default, do Lower B Friday at 5:30 and Conditioning B Saturday morning.
- Friday is lighter -- wrap up work early, no evening training. This prevents burnout.
- Saturday front-loads both remaining sessions. You are done by 8:30 AM and the rest of the day is yours.
- Sunday has two jobs: weekly planning at 4 PM and meal prep. Everything else is rest. Sleeping in 90 minutes on Sunday is a minor circadian disruption that most people recover from by Monday -- but if Monday mornings are brutal, keep Sunday at 6 AM too.
- Social time is scheduled, not leftover. Wednesday evening and Friday evening are protected slots. Move them, but do not delete them. See [social guidance](/social/index.md) for maintaining relationships on a training schedule.
- Meal prep on Sunday covers weekday lunches and most dinners, saving 30-60 minutes per weekday evening. See [nutrition guidance](/nutrition/index.md) for meal prep specifics.
- This schedule assumes remote work or a short commute. A 60-minute commute costs 10 hours per week. If you commute, the deep work block shifts to your arrival time, and training may need to move to mornings or lunchtimes.
- Cooking is not shown as a separate block because meal prep handles most of it. On non-prep days, simple dinners (reheating, assembling) take 15-20 minutes and fit into the 5:30-7:00 window alongside training.

## Protection Rules

What is negotiable and what is not.

**Non-negotiable (protect these first):**
1. Sleep: 9:30 PM bedtime, 6:00 AM wake time. Shift the pair if needed, but keep 8 hours. See [sleep guidance](/sleep/index.md).
2. Morning deep work block (6:30-8:30). This is where your most important work happens.
3. Weekly planning ritual (Sunday 4 PM).
4. Training sessions. Move them in the day but do not skip them.

**Negotiable (flex these when life happens):**
- Which training days map to which calendar days. Swap Tuesday and Wednesday if needed.
- Evening social time. Skip one week if you are behind, but not two consecutive weeks.
- The specific tasks in work blocks 2-4. Priorities shift; the blocks stay.
- Saturday structure. This is your buffer day.

**Hard stops:**
- No work after the shutdown ritual. If you regularly need to work evenings, the problem is not time management -- it is workload, and no scheduling system will fix that.
- No email before 8:30 AM. Every minute of morning deep work you trade for email costs you 3x in focus and energy.
- No new commitments without checking the weekly plan first. Say "let me check my calendar and get back to you" instead of "sure."

**Removed from the Base Program:**
- Morning meditation / journaling: valuable for some people but adds friction to the morning. If you want it, replace 15 minutes of the morning routine. Do not add it on top -- the schedule is already full. See [mental health guidance](/mental/index.md) if you want a meditation practice.
- Inbox zero as a daily goal: pursuing zero inbox trains you to prioritize email over deep work. Process email in batches; let unimportant messages sit.
- Evening planning sessions longer than 10 minutes: diminishing returns. If it takes longer than 10 minutes, you are over-planning.
- Separate "life admin" blocks: admin tasks (bills, appointments, errands) fit into Saturday or into the 5:30-7:00 slot on weekdays. They do not need their own ritual.

**Getting started (week 1):** Do not implement everything at once. Week 1: do the Sunday planning ritual and the morning deep work block. That's it. Week 2: add the evening shutdown ritual. Week 3: add the communication windows (batch email to 8:30/12:00/4:00). Week 4: add the full daily structure. By week 4, evaluate what is working and what needs adjustment. If you try to adopt the entire system on Monday, you will abandon it by Wednesday.

When you have run this program for 4+ weeks and the basic structure feels automatic, see the [Comprehensive Time Guide](#comprehensive-time-guide) below to understand the reasoning and customize for your [factors](#factors-for-time-decisions).

# Comprehensive Time Guide

## Energy Management

Time management frameworks assume all hours are equal. They are not. An hour at 7 AM after good sleep is worth two hours at 3 PM after back-to-back meetings. Schedule tasks based on energy, not just availability.

**High energy** (typically morning, after exercise, after breaks): Deep work, creative tasks, hard problems, important writing, strategic thinking. Protect this aggressively.

**Medium energy** (mid-morning, early afternoon): Collaborative work, meetings that require active thought, structured tasks with clear next steps.

**Low energy** (post-lunch, late afternoon, after long focus blocks): Shallow work, email, admin, scheduling, routine tasks. Do not waste willpower fighting low energy on creative work -- redirect it to tasks that need doing but not much thinking.

**Recovery** (evening, weekends, breaks): Actual rest. Not "productive rest" -- actual rest. Walking, cooking, socializing, reading for pleasure. Recovery is what makes high-energy blocks possible. Training fits here too -- exercise is both a time cost and an energy investment. A 60-minute lifting session costs an hour but returns higher energy and focus for the next 12-24 hours. This is why training is non-negotiable in the [protection rules](#protection-rules). See [mental health guidance](/mental/index.md#stress-management) for more on stress and recovery cycles.

"Ultradian rhythms" and other chronobiology frameworks removed: the research is real but the practical application is just "work when you have energy, rest when you don't." Track your energy for one week (see [Time Auditing](#time-auditing)) before rearranging. Most people's intuition about their energy patterns is wrong by 1-2 hours.

## Task Prioritization

Use a simplified Eisenhower matrix. Two questions for every task: Is this urgent? Is this important?

**Important + Urgent:** Do it now. These are rare if you plan well. If they are frequent, you are reacting, not planning.

**Important + Not Urgent:** Schedule it in a deep work block. This is where your weekly priorities live. Most of what actually matters in your career and life falls here. The entire point of time management is to protect space for this quadrant.

**Urgent + Not Important:** Delegate or time-box. Most email, most messages, most "quick favors." Give these 30 minutes in your communication window and stop.

**Not Urgent + Not Important:** Delete. Do not put it on a list. Do not "get to it later." Common examples: most social media, most news, most meetings without an agenda, most optional reports nobody reads.

The failure mode is not sorting incorrectly -- it is treating everything as Important + Urgent. If you have more than two Important + Urgent tasks per day, either your definition of "urgent" is too loose, or your workload exceeds your capacity, and the fix is [saying no](#saying-no), not better scheduling.

## Deep Work

Sustained, focused work on cognitively demanding tasks without distraction. Writing, coding, designing, analyzing, strategizing.

**Minimum viable block:** 90 minutes. Below this, you spend most of the time getting into flow and then stopping. 2 hours is better. 3+ hours is realistic only a few times per week.

**How to protect it:**
- Block it on your calendar as a meeting with yourself. Others cannot book over it.
- Turn off all notifications. Not "reduce" -- off. Phone on airplane mode or in another room.
- Close email, Slack, Teams. If your organization expects instant responses, negotiate a 2-hour response window.
- Have a single clear objective for the block. "Work on the project" is too vague. "Write the first draft of section 3" is specific enough to start immediately.
- If interrupted, note where you were and what you were about to do next. This reduces re-entry cost.

**How much per day:** 3-4 hours is the realistic maximum for most people. If you are getting 3 focused hours per day, you are doing well. Do not compare yourself to people who claim 8 hours -- they are counting something different.

**What does not count:** Meetings, email with long replies, collaborative brainstorming (valuable, but different), reading Slack threads, "research" that is actually browsing.

**When the block fails:** Some days you will sit down and nothing happens. Do not switch to email. Sit with the discomfort for 15 minutes. If focus does not come, switch to your second priority or a structured low-creativity task (editing, reviewing, organizing). The block is still protected -- you just redirected it. Log what happened and look for patterns: poor [sleep](/sleep/index.md), too many meetings the day before, and unclear task definition are the three most common causes.

## Shallow Work

Administrative, logistical, and communication tasks that do not require deep focus. Email, Slack, scheduling, expense reports, status updates, most meetings.

**Batch it.** Process email and messages in 2-3 dedicated windows per day (8:30 AM, 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM), not continuously. Every time you check email, you context-switch, and it costs 10-20 minutes to recover focus.

**Time-box it.** Give shallow work a fixed allocation: 2-3 hours per day maximum. If shallow work consistently exceeds this, you have a structural problem -- too many meetings, too much email, unclear responsibilities -- not a time management problem.

**When to do it.** Low-energy periods. After lunch. Late afternoon. Between meetings. Never during high-energy morning hours unless it is genuinely urgent.

[Pomodoro technique](#pomodoro-technique) removed from the Base Program: its 25-minute intervals are too short for deep work and unnecessary for shallow work, which already comes in small chunks. See the [reference section](#pomodoro-technique) if you want to try it.

## Transitions

Switching between tasks or contexts takes 10-25 minutes to fully re-engage. A day with 8 one-hour blocks of different work has only 4-5 productive hours, not 8.

**Minimize switches.** Batch similar tasks. Do all your email at once, all your code reviews at once, all your writing at once.

**Build transition buffers.** Schedule 10-15 minutes between meetings and between task types. Do not schedule meetings back-to-back.

**Protect your longest blocks.** A 3-hour uninterrupted block is not 3x as productive as three 1-hour blocks. It is 5-10x as productive for deep work, because you eliminate two transitions and reach a deeper level of focus.

**The cost of "just a quick question."** A 30-second interruption costs 10-15 minutes of refocusing. If you average 5 interruptions per deep work block, you are losing an hour. Communicate your availability: "I'm in a focus block until 10:30 -- can this wait?"

**Transition ritual:** When switching task types, take 2 minutes to close all tabs from the previous task, write one sentence about what you will do next, then start. This cuts re-engagement time roughly in half.

## Weekly Planning

The [weekly planning ritual](#weekly-planning-ritual) in the Base Program is the full process. Here is why the key steps matter.

**Three weekly priorities** because humans overestimate what they can do in a week and underestimate what they can do in a month. Three priorities with full deep-work blocks devoted to each will produce more output than seven priorities with scattered attention. If three was too many last week, set two.

**Decide what you are not doing** because the default is to carry an ever-growing list of "should do" items that fragment your attention even when you never work on them. Explicitly marking something as "not this week" removes it from your mental load.

## Daily Planning

Two touchpoints per day: morning review (5 minutes) and evening shutdown (10 minutes).

**Morning review (6:15 AM):** Look at today's three tasks (set the night before). Confirm the first task. Open the file, the document, the codebase -- whatever you need for the first deep work block. Remove friction between "sitting down" and "working."

**Evening shutdown (5:00 PM):** Review what got done. Write tomorrow's three tasks. Close all work tools. Perform the shutdown ritual. This prevents you from carrying unfinished thoughts into your evening and degrading your [sleep](/sleep/index.md) and recovery.

If you only do one thing from this entire document, do the evening shutdown. Writing tomorrow's tasks before you close your laptop is the single highest-leverage habit for reducing morning decision fatigue and evening work anxiety.

## Saying No

The most important time management skill is declining commitments. Every "yes" is a "no" to something else. Most people over-commit because saying yes feels good in the moment and the cost is invisible until later.

**Framework for deciding:**
1. Does this align with one of my three weekly priorities? If no, the default answer is no.
2. If I say yes, what am I saying no to? Name the specific thing that will not happen.
3. Would I be excited about this if it were happening tomorrow? (Not in three weeks when it feels abstract -- tomorrow.)

**Scripts for saying no:**
- "I can't take that on this week. Can we revisit next week?" (delay)
- "I don't have the bandwidth for that. Have you tried [person who might]?" (redirect)
- "I can do X or Y this week, but not both. Which is higher priority?" (force a tradeoff)
- "I'd like to help but I'm at capacity. If you need me on this, what should I drop?" (make the cost visible)
- "No." (complete sentence, use sparingly but remember it exists)

**Common situations:**
- **Boss adds work:** Use the tradeoff script. "I can do this -- what should I deprioritize?" Makes the constraint visible without being insubordinate.
- **Colleague asks for help:** "I'm in a focus block until [time]. Can I help you at [later time]?" Delay, don't refuse.
- **Social obligation you don't want:** "I appreciate the invite but I can't make it." No explanation needed. Over-explaining invites negotiation.
- **Your own idea:** The hardest no. Write ideas in a someday list and review it monthly. Most will not survive a month of perspective.

Productivity theater removed: attending meetings to be seen, responding to emails within minutes to seem available, staying late to signal commitment. These consume time while producing nothing. Identify which of your current activities are theater and cut them.

# Productivity Systems Reference

Every system below works for some people in some contexts. None work universally. The most common failure is adopting a system because it is popular rather than because it matches your [work type](#work-type), [personality](#personality), and [obligation load](#obligation-load).

| System | Best For | Worst For | Overhead | Pairs With |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Time Blocking](#time-blocking) | Knowledge workers with schedule control | Reactive roles | Medium | [Calendar Management](#calendar-management) |
| [To-Do Lists](#to-do-lists) | Simple capture, low commitment | Prioritization, time estimation | Low | Anything |
| [Calendar Management](#calendar-management) | People with many external commitments | Solo workers with few meetings | Low | [Time Blocking](#time-blocking) |
| [Pomodoro](#pomodoro-technique) | Overcoming procrastination, building focus | Deep work, creative flow | Low | [To-Do Lists](#to-do-lists) |
| [GTD](#getting-things-done) | High-volume diverse commitments | Simple workloads | High | [Digital tools](#digital-vs-analog-tools) |
| [Habit Stacking](#habit-stacking) | Building new routines | Complex decisions | None | Any system |

## Time Blocking

Assign every hour of the day to a specific task or category of work in advance.

**Good for:** People with control over their schedule. Knowledge workers. Anyone who struggles with "what should I do next?" decisions. Pairs naturally with [deep work](#deep-work) protection.

**Bad for:** Highly reactive roles (customer support, on-call engineering, retail). People whose days are genuinely unpredictable. Environments where meetings are scheduled by others with no regard for your blocks.

**Common failure modes:** Over-scheduling (no buffer time, no breaks, no slack). Treating the plan as sacred instead of a starting point -- when reality diverges, re-block, don't abandon. Spending more time planning blocks than doing the work.

Choose [time blocking](#time-blocking) over [to-do lists](#to-do-lists) when your problem is "I have too many things and don't know when to do them." Choose [to-do lists](#to-do-lists) over time blocking when your problem is "I forget what needs doing."

## To-Do Lists

A running list of tasks, checked off as completed.

**Good for:** Capturing tasks so you don't forget them. Providing a sense of progress. Low overhead.

**Bad for:** Prioritization. A to-do list with 30 items and no hierarchy is a source of anxiety, not clarity. Lists don't show how long things take or when you will do them.

**Common failure modes:** The list grows forever. Old items accumulate guilt. You cherry-pick easy tasks for the dopamine of checking boxes while important work stays undone. Multiple lists across different apps that you never consolidate.

**If you use a to-do list:** Keep it to 10 items maximum. Move anything beyond 10 to a "someday" list you review monthly. Star the top 3 for today. Delete anything that has been on the list for more than two weeks -- if you haven't done it in two weeks, you are not going to. Priority matrices on to-do lists (A1, A2, B1...) removed: if you need a matrix to figure out what to do next, you have too many items.

## Calendar Management

Using a calendar as the primary organizational tool -- if it is not on the calendar, it does not exist.

**Good for:** People with many external commitments. Coordinating with others. Seeing where your time actually goes. Protecting blocks.

**Bad for:** Solo workers with few meetings. People who rebel against rigid schedules. Over-schedulers who calendar 15-minute increments and then feel imprisoned.

**Common failure modes:** Only scheduling meetings and leaving "free time" unstructured, which then gets consumed by shallow work. Not blocking personal commitments (training, social, recovery), which signals they are optional. Letting others schedule over focus blocks because you haven't marked them as busy.

**Rule:** Block training, meal prep, social plans, and deep work on your calendar with the same weight as meetings. If someone tries to schedule over your deep work block, decline with the same confidence you would decline if you already had a meeting.

Choose [calendar management](#calendar-management) over [to-do lists](#to-do-lists) when the main challenge is protecting time from other people. Choose [to-do lists](#to-do-lists) when the main challenge is remembering what to do.

## Pomodoro Technique

Work in 25-minute focused intervals with 5-minute breaks. After four intervals, take a 15-30 minute break.

**Good for:** Getting started on tasks you are avoiding. Building focus stamina if you currently cannot concentrate for more than 15 minutes.

**Bad for:** Deep work. 25 minutes is too short to reach deep focus on complex problems. The timer interrupts flow rather than supporting it.

**Common failure modes:** Becoming dependent on the timer. Rigidly stopping at 25 minutes when you are in flow. Treating the technique as the work itself (tracking pomodoros completed instead of outcomes achieved).

Choose [Pomodoro](#pomodoro-technique) over [time blocking](#time-blocking) when you are struggling to start at all. Choose [time blocking](#time-blocking) over Pomodoro when you can focus but need to decide what to focus on. Graduate from Pomodoro to longer [deep work](#deep-work) blocks as your focus stamina improves.

## Getting Things Done

David Allen's system: capture everything into an inbox, clarify each item into an action, organize by context and project, review weekly, engage based on context.

**Good for:** People with a high volume of diverse commitments (managers, executives, freelancers with many clients). The weekly review habit is genuinely valuable.

**Bad for:** Most people. GTD is designed for executives with assistants and dozens of active projects. If you have one job and a manageable number of commitments, the full system is overkill. Anyone prone to over-engineering their productivity setup will spend more time maintaining GTD than doing work.

**Common failure modes:** Spending more time organizing the system than doing work. Treating "capture everything" as permission to never say no. Building elaborate project lists and context tags that you never review. Switching GTD apps every few months.

The weekly review is the only part worth adopting universally. The [weekly planning ritual](#weekly-planning-ritual) in this document is a simplified version. Context lists, tickler files, and the 43-folder system removed: overhead exceeds value for most people.

## Digital vs Analog Tools

**Digital** (calendar apps, task managers, note apps): Searchable, sync across devices, reminders, shareable. Better for scheduling, recurring tasks, and anything collaborative.

**Analog** (paper planner, notebook, index cards): No notifications, no app-switching temptation, forces brevity. Better for daily planning, morning reviews, and capturing ideas without getting sucked into a screen.

**What works:** Use digital for your calendar and anything shared with others. Use analog for your daily task list and planning sessions.

**What doesn't work:** Pure digital with 6 apps that don't talk to each other. Pure analog when you need to coordinate with a team. Any system that requires more than 2 tools.

"Productivity apps" removed as a separate section: the specific app does not matter. Any calendar app and any note-taking method will work. If you are spending time researching productivity tools, you are procrastinating.

## Habit Stacking

Attach a new behavior to an existing habit. "After I pour my morning coffee, I review today's three tasks." "After I close my laptop at 5, I write tomorrow's tasks."

**Good for:** Building the rituals in this document (morning review, evening shutdown, weekly planning). Making new behaviors automatic by piggybacking on established routines.

**Bad for:** Complex behaviors that require active decision-making. Habits that don't have a natural trigger point.

**Common failure modes:** Stacking too many habits at once. Choosing an anchor habit that is itself inconsistent. Expecting the new behavior to feel automatic immediately -- it takes 30-60 days of consistency.

The morning routine and shutdown ritual in the [Base Program](#base-program) are designed as habit stacks. Follow the sequence in order. After four weeks, the sequence should feel automatic.

**Specific stacks from this document:**
- After pouring coffee -> review today's three tasks (morning review)
- After closing laptop lid -> write tomorrow's three tasks (evening shutdown)
- After sitting down Sunday at 4 PM -> open calendar for weekly planning
- After arriving at gym -> put phone in locker (removes distraction during training)
- After finishing dinner -> set phone to Do Not Disturb (protects wind-down)

If a stack is not sticking after two weeks, the anchor habit is too inconsistent or the new behavior is too complex. Simplify or choose a different anchor.

# Time Auditing

You cannot improve what you do not measure. Before optimizing your schedule, find out where your time actually goes. Most people's estimates are off by 2-3 hours per day.

**Method (one week):**

1. **Track.** For one work week (Monday-Friday), record what you are doing every 30 minutes. Set a recurring timer. When it goes off, write what you were doing in one sentence. Use paper or a simple spreadsheet. Do not use a complex time-tracking app -- the overhead defeats the purpose.

2. **Categorize.** At the end of the week, label each 30-minute block:
   - **Deep work:** Focused, uninterrupted work on important tasks.
   - **Shallow work:** Email, messages, admin, routine tasks.
   - **Meetings:** Scheduled meetings, calls, 1:1s.
   - **Transitions:** Getting started, switching tasks, recovering from interruptions.
   - **Breaks:** Intentional rest, lunch, walks.
   - **Waste:** Social media during work hours, unplanned browsing, meetings you didn't need to attend.

3. **Analyze.** Total the hours per category. Common findings:
   - Deep work: 1-2 hours/day (most people are shocked by how low this is).
   - Shallow work: 2-3 hours/day.
   - Meetings: 1-3 hours/day (role-dependent).
   - Transitions: 1-2 hours/day (the invisible leak).
   - Waste: 1-2 hours/day.

4. **Adjust.** Compare your actual distribution to the target. The Base Program targets:
   - Deep work: 3-4 hours/day.
   - Shallow work: 2 hours/day.
   - Meetings: as few as possible, batched together.
   - Transitions: under 1 hour/day (achieved by batching and buffering).
   - Waste: under 30 minutes/day.

The gap between your current and target distribution tells you where to focus. If deep work is low, the problem is usually too many transitions and too much unstructured shallow work, not a lack of hours.

**Common findings and fixes:**
- Deep work under 2 hours/day + transitions over 1.5 hours/day: You are context-switching too often. Batch similar tasks and protect longer blocks.
- Shallow work over 3 hours/day: You are processing communication in real time instead of batching. Set 2-3 email windows and close messaging between them.
- Meetings over 3 hours/day: Decline meetings without agendas. Ask for a written update instead. Propose 25-minute meetings instead of 60-minute ones.
- Waste over 1 hour/day: Install a site blocker during work hours. Put your phone in another room. This is not a discipline problem -- it is an environment design problem.

Run a time audit every 8-12 weeks. Track deep work hours per day. Aim to increase by 30 minutes per audit cycle until you reach 3-4 hours. Beyond that, diminishing returns.

# Factors for Time Decisions

There is no universally correct schedule. The best structure depends on your work, your energy, and your life constraints. The factors below help you adapt the [Base Program](#base-program) to your situation.

| Category | Factor | Key Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Work Type](#work-type) | Nature of work | Does my work require long focus blocks or rapid responses? |
| [Energy Patterns](#energy-patterns) | Chronotype | When am I sharpest, and when do I crash? |
| [Obligation Load](#obligation-load) | Fixed commitments | How many hours per week are committed before I start planning? |
| [Season of Life](#season-of-life) | Life stage | What external constraints does my current situation impose? |
| [Personality](#personality) | Preference | Do I thrive with rigid structure or flexible frameworks? |
| [Goals](#goals) | Optimization target | What am I trying to maximize this year? |

## Work Type

**Knowledge work (writing, coding, design, analysis):** The Base Program is built for this. Long deep work blocks are essential. Protect mornings. Batch meetings into the afternoon.

**Creative work (art, music, writing fiction):** Similar to knowledge work but more sensitive to mood. Keep the deep work blocks but accept that some will be generative and others won't. The structure ensures you sit down; the output varies.

**Meetings-heavy (management, sales, consulting):** The morning deep work block becomes critical because it may be your only uninterrupted time. Protect it ruthlessly. Batch all meetings into two or three contiguous blocks.

**Reactive work (support, operations, on-call):** Time blocking fails for reactive roles. Use the [Pomodoro technique](#pomodoro-technique) to carve small focus windows between demands. Set one priority per day instead of three.

**Hybrid roles (some deep, some reactive):** Most jobs. The Base Program handles this by concentrating deep work in the morning before reactive demands start. If your reactive demands start at 7 AM, shift the deep work block to 5:30-7:00 AM. The key is having at least one protected block per day, even if it is only 60 minutes.

## Energy Patterns

**Morning person (peak 6-10 AM):** The Base Program is designed for you. Front-load deep work, train after work.

**Afternoon person (peak 10 AM-2 PM):** Shift deep work to mid-morning. Use early morning for exercise (it may boost your energy for the peak window). Process email and shallow work first thing.

**Night owl (peak 8 PM-12 AM):** Harder with a standard work schedule. Options: negotiate a later start time, use the 8-10 PM window for personal deep work (side projects, learning), or gradually shift your schedule earlier by 15 minutes per week. Do not fight your chronotype with willpower -- it is largely genetic and willpower loses.

Track your energy for one week before deciding which pattern you are. Use the [time audit](#time-auditing) method, but also rate your energy 1-5 at each check-in.

## Obligation Load

**Low obligation (single, no dependents, flexible job):** You have the most scheduling freedom. The risk is wasting it because nothing forces structure. Follow the Base Program strictly for 4 weeks to build the habit, then customize.

**Medium obligation (partner, regular social commitments, structured job):** The Base Program fits with minor adjustments. Coordinate training and social time with your partner's schedule. A shared calendar is not optional if you live with someone -- unilateral time blocking creates resentment.

**High obligation (young children, caregiving, demanding job + side work):** The full structure may not fit. Reduce to: one deep work block per day (even 60 minutes counts), training 3x per week instead of 6, and the weekly planning ritual. Protect less, but protect something.

## Season of Life

**Student:** More discretionary time than you think, but less external structure. The Base Program's daily structure is especially valuable because nobody else is going to create it for you.

**Early career:** The highest-leverage time to build these habits. Your obligations are likely lower than they will ever be again. The risk is overworking because you have no external constraints -- set hard stops even if nobody is enforcing them.

**Mid-career with young children:** Time is most constrained. Accept that your schedule will be interrupted. Build shorter blocks (60-90 minutes instead of 2 hours). Train in the early morning before children wake or during lunch. This is a season, not a permanent state.

**Later career:** You likely have more control over your schedule. The risk is meetings and management overhead crowding out focused work. If more than 40% of your work hours are meetings, you are a meeting attendee, not a producer. Delegate, decline, or restructure.

**Transition periods (new job, new city, new baby):** Abandon the full system temporarily. Keep only three things: consistent [sleep](/sleep/index.md), one deep work block per day, and the weekly planning ritual. Rebuild once the transition stabilizes, typically 4-8 weeks.

## Personality

**High structure preference:** The Base Program is for you. Follow it closely.

**Low structure preference:** Rigid schedules feel suffocating. Use a lighter version: set three weekly priorities, protect the morning deep work block and the weekly planning ritual, and leave the rest flexible.

**Perfectionist tendency:** Your risk is spending too much time planning and too little time doing. Limit planning to the weekly ritual (30 min) and daily review (5 min). If you are spending more than 45 minutes per week on meta-productivity, stop. Also watch for the trap of optimizing your system instead of using it -- color-coding your calendar, researching apps, reading productivity books. That is procrastination in a productive disguise.

## Goals

**Optimizing for career:** Maximize deep work hours. Accept tradeoffs in social time during push periods. But set an end date -- "I'll work weekends for the next 6 weeks to ship this" is a plan. "I'll work weekends until things calm down" is denial, because things never calm down. Cap push periods at 8 weeks and take a recovery week after.

**Optimizing for health:** Protect [training](/lift/index.md) and [sleep](/sleep/index.md) as non-negotiable, even if it means less work output. A career built on chronic sleep deprivation and no exercise will collapse -- the question is when, not if.

**Optimizing for relationships:** Protect [social blocks](/social/index.md) with the same rigor as deep work blocks. Schedule them. Show up for them. Relationships atrophy from neglect faster than careers do.

**Optimizing for all of the above:** This is most people. The Base Program is designed for this case. You will not be world-class at any single one -- but you will be functional across all of them. The [sample week](#sample-week) allocates roughly: 35 hours to work (including deep work), 6-8 hours to training, 56 hours to sleep, 4-6 hours to social, and the rest to meals, commuting, and recovery. If your actual distribution is dramatically different, audit which category is eating the others.
